abstract = {The traditional way of identifying targets of adaptive evolution has been to study a few loci that one hypothesizes a priori to have been under selection. This approach is complicated because of the confounding effects that population demographic history and selection have on patterns of DNA sequence variation. In principle, multilocus analyses can facilitate robust inferences of selection at individual loci. The deluge of large-scale catalogs of genetic variation has stimulated many genome-wide scans for positive selection in several species. Here, we review some of the salient observations of these studies, identify important challenges ahead, consider the limitations of genome-wide scans for selection and discuss the potential significance of a comprehensive understanding of genomic patterns of selection for disease-related research. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Estrogens have been shown to modulate immune responses. Several studies have demonstrated the capacity of T cells, B cells, and monocytes to respond to estrogens and estrogen receptor (ER) expression in these cell types has been reported. However, little is known regarding the relative expression in these cells of ER?? and the more recently identified ER??. In the present study, results of quantitative TaqMan??? RT-PCR analyses indicate that ERs are differentially expressed in PBMC subsets. CD4 + T cells express relatively high levels of ER?? mRNA compared with ER??, whereas B cells express high levels of ER?? mRNA but low levels of ER??. Peripheral blood CD8 + T cells and monocytes express low but comparable levels of both ERs. This quantitative analysis of ER expression in distinct PBMC subsets may provide a basis for dissecting the mechanisms of immune modulation by estrogens and identifying therapeutic targets for the treatment of inflammatory and immunologic disorders. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Germ-line and somatic mutations in genes that promote homology-directed repair (HDR), especially BRCA1 and BRCA2, are frequently observed in several cancers, in particular, breast and ovary but also prostate and other cancers. HDR is critical for the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other lesions, and HDR factors also protect stalled replication forks. As a result, loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 poses significant risks to genome integrity, leading not only to cancer predisposition but also to sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, affecting therapeutic approaches. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2, including how they genetically interact with other repair factors, how they protect stalled replication forks, how they affect the response to aldehydes, and how loss of their functions links to mutation signatures. Importantly, given the recent advances with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) for the treatment of HDR-deficient tumors, we discuss mechanisms by which BRCA-deficient tumors acquire resistance to PARPi and other agents.},

@article{Traill2010a,
abstract = {To ensure both long-term persistence and evolutionary potential, the required number of individuals in a population often greatly exceeds the targets proposed by conservation management. We critically review minimum population size requirements for species based on empirical and theoretical estimates made over the past few decades. This literature collectively shows that thousands (not hundreds) of individuals are required for a population to have an acceptable probability of riding-out environmental fluctuation and catastrophic events, and ensuring the continuation of evolutionary processes. The evidence is clear, yet conservation policy does not appear to reflect these findings, with pragmatic concerns on feasibility over-riding biological risk assessment. As such, we argue that conservation biology faces a dilemma akin to those working on the physical basis of climate change, where scientific recommendations on carbon emission reductions are compromised by policy makers. There is no obvious resolution other than a more explicit acceptance of the trade-offs implied when population viability requirements are ignored. We recommend that conservation planners include demographic and genetic thresholds in their assessments, and recognise implicit triage where these are not met. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: Angiogenesis is a prerequisite for airway remodeling in bronchial asthma. Several growth factors may play important roles in inflammation and angiogenesis through effects on inflammatory cell infiltration or neovascularization. Objective: We sought to compare bronchial vascularity and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and angiogenin in bronchial biopsy specimens from asthmatic and healthy control subjects. Methods: Bronchial biopsy specimens were obtained from 16 asthmatic subjects and 9 normal control subjects. The number of vessel profiles and the vascular area per unit area on a histologic section were estimated by using computerized image analysis after staining for type IV collagen in vessel walls. Numbers of VEGF+, bFGF+, and angiogenin+cells were determined by means of immunoreactivity. Results: The airways of asthmatic subjects had significantly more vessels (P {\textless} .05) and greater vascular area (P {\textless} .O01) than that observed in control subjects. Asthmatic subjects exhibited higher VEGF and bFGF and angiogenin immunore-activity in the submucosa than did control subjects (P {\textless} .001, respectively). Significant correlations were detected between the vascular area and the numbers of angiogenic factor-positive cells (VEGF: rs= 0.93, P {\textless} .001; bFGF: rs= 0.83, P {\textless} .001; angiogenin: rs= 0.88, P {\textless} .001) within the asthmatic airways. Furthermore, the degree of vascularity was inversely correlated with airway caliber and airway responsiveness. Colocalization analysis revealed that the angiogenic factor-positive cells were CD34+cells, eosinophils, and macrophages. Conclusion: Our results suggest that increased vascularity of the bronchial mucosa in asthmatic subjects is closely related to the expression of angiogenic factors, which may then contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma.},

The longer-term effects of estrogen are produced, at least in part, by changes in vascular cell gene and protein expression that are mediated by the ligand-activated transcription factors, estrogen receptor (ER)-$\alpha$ and ER-$\beta$. The rapid vasodilatory effects of estrogen do not require changes in gene expression and are produced by estrogen-stimulated increases in endothelial cell nitric oxide synthase activity. This results in nitric oxide-mediated increases in cyclic guanosine monophosphate in vascular smooth muscle cells, which mediate vasodilatation.

abstract = {Steroid hormones (SHs) are lipophilic molecules derived from cholesterol and synthesized in the adrenal cortex (glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and adrenal androgens), the testes (testicular androgens, oestrogen), and the ovary and placenta (oestrogens and progestagens or progestins). SHs reach their target cells via the blood, where they are bound to carrier proteins, and because of their lipophilic nature pass the cell membrane by simple diffusion. Within the target cells SHs bind to steroid hormone receptors (SHRs), the key mediators of SH action, which are complexed to chaperones, e.g. heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), that help other proteins to fold and prevent aggregation. SHRs are intracellular transcription factors that can be activated, among other possibilities, by the specific and high affinity binding of ligand to exert positive or negative effects on the expression of target genes. Binding of agonistic or antagonistic ligands leads to different allosteric changes of SHRs making them competent to exert positive or negative effects on the expression of target genes by different mechanisms. (i) After dissociation of chaperones the liganded SHR-complexes can bind to chromatin organized DNA sequences in the vicinity of target genes, termed hormone response elements (HREs). The HRE-recruited hormone-receptor-complexes are then able to initiate chromatin remodelling and to relay activating or repressing signals to the target genes transcription machinery; (ii) through protein-protein interactions with other sequence-specific transcription factors, SHRs can also regulate the activity of many genes that are switched on, for instance, during stress or an inflammatory response; (iii) the SH response can also be integrated in the intracellular signalling network via cross-talk of SHRs with signal transduction pathways that transmit extracellular signals via membrane receptors and activation of protein kinase cascades to nuclear transcription factors that activate various target genes. By all these different mechanisms SHRs modulate numerous and specific responses in a large variety of cells, whereby their particular effect depends on the physiological, cellular and genetic context.},

abstract = {The term "lymphoma" describes a heterogeneous group of disorders involving monoclonal proliferation of malignant lymphocytes. As a group, lymphomas are among the most common tumors of dogs. Yet our enumeration and understanding of the many subtypes of lymphoma have been relatively slow, perhaps in part because for many years lymphoma was treated as a singular entity rather than a group of distinct diseases. The recognition that the full spectrum of lymphoid malignancies seen in humans also occurs in dogs, and that these tumors retain not only morphologic similarities and biological behavior but also synonymous driver molecular abnormalities, sets an ideal stage for dual-purpose research that can accelerate progress for these diseases in both species. Specifically, dogs represent exceptional models for defining causality, understanding progression, and developing new treatments for lymphoma in comparatively brief windows of time. Unique advantages of canine models include (1) spontaneous disease occurring without an isogenic background or genetic engineering ; (2) chronology of disease adapted to lifespan, (3) shared environment and societal status that allows dogs to be treated as "patients," while at the same time being able to ethically explore translational innovations that are not possible in human subjects; and (4) organization of dogs into breeds with relatively homogeneous genetic backgrounds and distinct predisposition for lymphomas. Here, we will review recent studies describing intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of canine and human lymphomas, as well as newly developed tools that will enhance the fidelity of these models to improve diagnosis and develop new treatments. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

It has been known for many years that FA patient-derived cells are exquisitely sensitive to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents such as cisplatin and mitomycin C. On this basis, it was widely assumed that failure to repair endogenous interstrand cross-links (ICLs) causes FA, although the endogenous mutagen that generates these lesions remained elusive. Recent genetic evidence now suggests that endogenous aldehydes are the driving force behind FA. Importantly, aldehydes cause a variety of DNA lesions, including ICLs and DNA protein cross-links (DPCs), re-kindling the debate about which DNA lesions cause FA. In this review, we discuss new developments in our understanding of DPC and ICL repair, and how these findings bear on the question of which DNA lesion underlies FA.},

abstract = {Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases, PI3Ks, constitute a lipid kinase family characterized by their ability to phosphorylate inositol ring 3′-OH group in inositol phospholipids to generate the second messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI-3,4,5-P3). RPTK activation results in PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 production by PI3K at the inner side of the plasma membrane. Akt interacts with these phospholipids, causing its translocation to the inner membrane, where it is phosphorylated and activated by PDK1 and PDK2. Activated Akt modulates the function of numerous substrates involved in the regulation of cell survival, cell cycle progression and cellular growth. In recent years, it has been shown that PI3K/Akt signalling pathway components are frequently altered in human cancers. Cancer treatment by chemotherapy and $\gamma$-irradiation kills target cells primarily by the induction of apoptosis. However, the development of resistance to therapy is an important clinical problem. Failure to activate the apoptotic programme represents an important mode of drug resistance in tumor cells. Survival signals induced by several receptors are mediated mainly by PI3K/Akt, hence this pathway may decisively contribute to the resistant phenotype. Many of the signalling pathways involved in cellular transformation have been elucidated and efforts are underway to develop treatment strategies that target these specific signalling molecules or their downstream effectors. The PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in many of the mechanisms targeted by these new drugs, thus a better understanding of this crossroad can help to fully exploit the potential benefits of these new agents.},

Estimates of population genetic summary statistics from the pooled data are similar to previous estimates, suggesting that pooled sequencing is reliable. The nonsynonymous SNPs tended to have both lower frequency differences and lower FST values between the two domains than silent ones. These results suggest the presence of purifying selection. The divergence between the two domains based on synonymous changes was around 5 million yr, a time similar to a recent phylogenetic estimate of 6 million yr, but much larger than earlier estimates based on isozymes. Two approaches, one of them novel and that considers both FST and difference in allele frequencies between the two domains, were used to identify SNPs potentially under diversifying selection. SNPs from around 20 genes were detected, including genes previously identified as main target for selection, such as PaPRR3 and PaGI.},

abstract = {The paradoxical effects of ovarian hormones in both the promotion and prevention of breast cancer have been debated for over 30 years. Genetic studies have demonstrated that ovarian hormones act through NF-kappaB to stimulate proliferation and ductal elongation, whereas the p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a central role in rendering the mammary epithelium resistant to tumorigenesis. Transcriptional profiles now suggest that ovarian hormones stimulate a constellation of genes that interact with NF-kappaB and p53 to arbitrate the competing demands for proliferation and surveillance. Genes that participate in chromatin remodeling are among the acute transcriptional responses to estrogens and progestins. These genes are proposed to initiate epigenetic programs that influence the balance between proliferation and surveillance, and render the breast epithelium resistant to tumors.},

In one cat, C1, cell-mediated immunity was depressed throughout the monitoring period but particularly from 125–200 weeks post-infection (pi), when this cat demonstrated profoundly impaired lymphocyte blastogenesis and markedly increased interleukin-1 (IL-1) production compared to age-matched, uninfected control cats. Lymphocyte function in the other cat, C2, was preserved to a greater degree. Alterations in the levels of immunoglobulin isotypes M, A and G in CD4+-, CD8+- and CD21+-lymphocyte sub-sets were demonstrated in both cats. Southern blot analysis revealed the presence of integrated FIV-provirus in tumour DNA from C2 but not C1 indicating a possible direct role for the virus in the former case only.

Twenty-eight dogs received conventional chemotherapy, 13 receivedcyclophosphamide-based metronomic chemotherapy, and 13 received both conventionaland metronomic chemotherapy. Median survival time of dogs treated with splenectomyalone was 1.6 months. Clinical stage was the only prognostic factor significantly associatedwith survival time. When the entire follow-up period was considered, there was no significantdifference in survival time between dogs treated with surgery alone and dogs treatedwith surgery and chemotherapy. However, during the first 4 months of follow-up, afteradjusting for the effects of clinical stage, survival time was significantly prolonged amongdogs receiving any type of chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.6) and among dogs receiving bothconventional and metronomic chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.4).Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Clinical stage was strongly associated with prognosisfor dogs with splenic hemangiosarcoma. Chemotherapy was effective in prolonging survivaltime during the early portion of the follow-up period. Combinations of doxorubicin-basedconventional protocols and cyclophosphamide-based metronomic protocols appeared to bemore effective than either type of chemotherapy alone, but prolongations in survival timeresulting from current protocols were modest.},

We show here that PPARgamma is expressed at high levels in both well- and poorly-differentiated adenocarcinomas, in normal colonic mucosa and in human colon cancer cell lines. Ligand activation of this receptor in colon cancer cells causes a considerable reduction in linear and clonogenic growth, increased expression of carcinoembryonic antigen and the reversal of many gene expression events specifically associated with colon cancer. Transplantable tumors derived from human colon cancer cells show a significant reduction of growth when mice are treated with troglitazone, a PPARgamma ligand.

Although the standard treatments (including limb amputation/sparing, chemotherapy and palliative radiotherapy) have significantly increased survival rates, almost 90{\%} of animals will eventually develop predominantly pulmonary metastases. Despite advances in various therapies, prognosis remains poor, with median survival times ranging from 3. months to 1. year and {\textless}20{\%} of dogs survive for {\textgreater}2. years following diagnosis.Various clinical and epidemiological markers have facilitated decision-making with respect to therapy but no single molecular biomarker has been shown to enhance prediction of disease progression. The publication of the canine genome in 2005 raised the possibility of increasing understanding of the genetic mechanisms underpinning canine OS. This review explores the use of biomarkers within the multi-disciplinary management of dogs with OS, and highlights the few known, potential prognostic/predictive molecular markers including their potential value as 'bridging biomarkers' for human OS. Although high-throughput profiling of canine OS remains in its infancy, research within the next decade using leading-edge screening technologies has the potential to identify biomarkers that may enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracy and result in more effective, individually tailored, treatment and management protocols for affected dogs. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Further, serum IgE levels are much higher in allergic female mice compared to male mice. Ovariectomized rats developed less airway inflammation compared to sham controls.

In humans, a much higher asthma prevalence was found in women at reproductive age as compared to men.

Around 30-40{\%} of women who have asthma experienced worsening of their symptoms during the perimenstrual phase, the so-called perimenstrual asthma. Postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy have an increased risk of new onset of asthma. Beside, estrus cycle dependent changes on female sex hormones are related to changes on MC number in mouse uterine tissue and estradiol and progesterone were shown to induce uterine MC maturation and degranulation.

abstract = {Abstract: We established a canine hemangiosarcoma cell line derived from malignant endothelial cells comprising a spontaneous tumor in a dog to provide a renewable source of endothelial cells for studies of angiogenesis in malignancy. Pieces of the hemangiosarcoma biopsy were engrafted subcutaneously in a bg/nu/XID mouse allowing the tumor cells to expand in vivo. A cell line, SB-HSA, was derived from the xenograft. SB-HSA cells expressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1 and 2, CD31, CD146, and $\alpha$v$\beta$3 integrin, and produced several growth factors and cytokines, including VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin (IL)-8 that are stimulatory to endothelial cell growth. These results indicated that the cells recapitulated features of mitotically activated endothelia. In vivo, SB-HSA cells stimulated robust angiogenic responses in mice and formed tumor masses composed of aberrant vascular channels in immunocompromised mice providing novel opportunities for investigating the effectiveness of antiangiogenic agents. Using this model, we determined that IL-12, a cytokine with both immunostimulatory and antiangiogenic effects, suppressed angiogenesis induced by, and tumor growth of, SB-HSA cells. The endothelial cell model we have described offers unique opportunities to pursue further investigations with IL-12, as well as other antiangiogenic approaches in cancer therapy.},

abstract = {The steroid hormone 17␤-estradiol (E 2) is a key regulator of growth, differentiation, and function in a wide array of target tissues, including the male and female reproductive tracts, mam-mary gland, and skeletal and cardiovascular systems. The predom-inant biological effects of E 2 are mediated through two distinct intracellular receptors, ER␣ 1 and ER␤, each encoded by unique genes (1) but possessing the hallmark modular structure of func-tional domains characteristic of the steroid/thyroid hormone super-family of nuclear receptors (introduced in the Minireview Prologue (54)). Certain functional domains of the ER␣ and ER␤ exhibit a high degree of homology, namely the DNA-and ligand-binding domains, at 97 and 60{\%}, respectively, whereas considerable diver-gence is apparent in the N terminus (18{\%} homology). Hence, ER␣ and ER␤ interact with identical DNA response elements and ex-hibit a similar binding affinity profile for an array of endogenous, synthetic, and naturally occurring estrogens when assayed in vitro (2). In vitro studies also suggest the two receptors may play redun-dant roles in estrogen signaling; however, tissue localization stud-ies have revealed distinct expression patterns for each receptor that suggest otherwise. Whereas ER␣ is the predominant subtype expressed in the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, and several addi-tional target organs, ER␤ exhibits a more limited expression pat-tern and is primarily detected in the ovary, prostate, testis, spleen, lung, hypothalamus, and thymus (3). Regional expression differ-ences of the two receptors have been identified in the brain (4). Further evidence of distinct biological functions for the ERs is revealed by the contrasting phenotypes observed in the individual lines of ER knockout mice, the ␣ERKO and ␤ERKO, which exhibit phenotypes that generally mirror the respective ER expression patterns (5). The most striking phenotypes in the female ␣ERKO mice include estrogen insensitivity (leading to hypoplasia) in the reproductive tract, hypergonadotropic hypergonadism, lack of pu-bertal mammary gland development, and excess adipose tissue, whereas in the male, testicular degeneration and epididymal dys-function are major factors (5). These phenotypes combined with severe deficits in sexual behavior result in complete infertility in both sexes of the ␣ERKO. In contrast, ␤ERKO males are fertile and to date show no obvious phenotypes; however, ␤ERKO females exhibit inefficient ovarian function and subfertility. Interestingly, compound knockout mice (␣␤ERKO) exhibit phenotypes that most heavily resemble those of the ␣ERKO, with the exception of the ovarian phenotype, characterized by progressive germ cell loss accompanied by redifferentiation of the surrounding somatic cells, suggesting a requisite role for both ER forms in this tissue (6, 7). With the cloning of the first ER cDNA 15 years ago has come an immense appreciation of the complex molecular mechanisms un-derlying the diverse physiological actions of E 2 and the multitude of synthetic ER ligands. This minireview will discuss the recent pro-gress toward our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of estrogen signaling, focusing on the following four pathways: 1) classical ligand-dependent; 2) ligand-independent; 3) DNA bind-ing-independent; and 4) cell-surface (nongenomic) signaling (Fig. 1). Insights into these cellular/molecular mechanisms and the role of each ER subtype as revealed by ER-null animal models will be incorporated. A discussion of the mechanisms of action of several relevant selective ER modulator (SERM) ligands and their activi-ties through the different ER signaling pathways will follow. Classical Mechanism of Estrogen Action: Ligand-dependent The ligand-dependent mechanism of ER action is the defining element of the Class I members of the nuclear steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily (8), of which the ER␣ and -␤ are members (Fig. 1). This model states that in the absence of hormone, the receptor is sequestered in a multiprotein inhibitory complex within the nuclei of target cells. The binding of ligand induces an activat-ing conformational change within the ER and promotes ho-modimerization and high affinity binding to specific DNA response elements (EREs), which are cis-acting enhancers located within the regulatory regions of target genes. The DNA-bound receptors con-tact the general transcription apparatus either directly or indi-rectly via cofactor proteins (9), of which several have been identi-fied, including SRC-1, GRIP1, AIB1, CBP/p300, TRAP220, PGC-1, p68 RNA helicase, and SRA (discussed in the first Minireview of this series (55)). It is generally accepted that the ER-coactivator interactions stabilize the formation of a transcription preinitiation complex and facilitate the necessary disruption of chromatin at the ERE. Depending on the cell and promoter context, the DNA-bound receptor exerts either a positive or negative effect on expression of the downstream target gene. The ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of ER␣ is medi-ated by two separate nonacidic activation domains, a constitutive activation function-1 (AF-1) located within the N terminus (A/B domain) and a hormone-dependent AF-2, located in the ligand-binding domain (10). The AF-2 functional domain includes a highly conserved amphipathic ␣-helix (H12) that is essential for ligand-dependent transcriptional activity and interaction with members of the SRC family of coactivators (9, 11). AF-1 activity is also depend-ent on recruitment of coactivators, both similar and unique from those utilized by AF-2 (9, 12). The AFs function in a synergistic manner in most ligand-activated mechanisms but may also func-tion independently in certain cell and promoter contexts (13). Whereas the activation domains of ER␣ are well characterized, it is not yet clear how the homologous regions of ER␤ contribute to the transcriptional activity of the receptor. Sequence homology and in vitro studies do indicate that ER␤ also contains an AF-2 domain within the C terminus (14 –16); however, reports that this region functions independently within ER␤ (15) imply the AF-2 domains of the two ER subtypes play different roles. The high degree of sequence divergence in the N terminus, including the lack of a functional AF-1 in the human ER␤ subtype, also suggests this region may function differently (14, 15). Furthermore, murine ER␤ contains an AF-1 region very similar to that of ER␣ in both se-quence and function (17), indicating that extrapolations of findings between species may be difficult. The ERKO mice have proven useful in confirming the ligand-de-pendent ERE-mediated mechanisms of ER signaling that were postulated from previous target gene promoter analyses and in vitro studies. Perhaps the best illustrative examples of classical E 2 -ER-ERE-mediated gene induction are those exhibited by the},

Recent reports have revealed that the deregulation of miRNAs correlates with various human cancers and is involved in the initiation and progression of human cancers. miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors to inhibit the expression of cancer-related target genes and to promote or suppress tumorigenesis in various tissues. Therefore, abnormal miRNA expression can be regarded as a common feature of human cancers, and the identification of miRNAs and their respective targets may provide potential diagnostic and prognostic tumor biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies to treat cancers.

abstract = {Cancer cells show various types of mutations and aberrant expression in genes involved in DNA repair responses. These alterations induce genome instability and promote carcinogenesis steps and cancer progression processes. These defects in DNA repair have also been considered as suitable targets for cancer therapies. A most effective target so far clinically demonstrated is “homologous recombination repair defect” such as BRCA1/2 mutations, which were shown to cause synthetic lethality with inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which in turn is involved in DNA repair as well as multiple physiological processes. Different approaches targeting genomic instability, including immune therapy targeting mismatch-repair deficiency, have also recently been demonstrated to be promising strategies. In these DNA repair targeting-strategies, common issues could be how to optimize treatment and suppress/conquer the development of drug resistance. In this article, we review the extending framework of DNA repair response pathways and the potential impact of exploiting those defects on cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immune therapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer is a major cause of death in domestic animals. Furthermore, many forms of pet neoplasm resemble that of their human counterparts in biologic behaviour, pathologic expression, and recognised risk factors.In April 2005, a pilot project was activated so as to establish a dog and cat tumour registry living in the Venice and Vicenza provinces (Veneto Region, north-eastern Italy), with the aim of estimating the incidence of spontaneous tumours. RESULTS: Through a telephone survey, the estimates of canine and feline populations of the catchment area turned out to be of 296,318 (CI +/- 30,201) and 214,683 (CI +/- 21,755) subjects, respectively. During the first three years, overall 2,509 canine and 494 feline cases of neoplasia were diagnosed. In dogs, the estimated annual incidence rate (IR) per 100,000 dogs for all tumours was 282 in all the catchment area, whereas in cats the IR was much lower (IR = 77). Malignant and benign tumours were equally distributed in male and female dogs, whereas cats had a 4.6-fold higher incidence of malignant tumours than benign. In both dogs and cats, purebreds had an almost 2-fold higher incidence of malignant tumours than mixed breeds. Tumour incidence increased with age in both dog and cat populations. CONCLUSION: This study has provided estimates of incidence of spontaneous neoplasm in companion animals. Further attempts will be made to increase the accuracy in the population size assessment and to ascertain the real gap with the official regional canine demographic registry. Veterinary practitioners may also benefit from the tumour registry insofar they may obtain data for specific breeds, age groups or geographical areas.},

These experiments, together with an evaluation of the inhibition of transcription and proteasome action, demonstrate that proteasome-mediated degradation and hER$\alpha$-mediated transactivation are inherently linked and act to continuously turn over hER$\alpha$ on responsive promoters.

abstract = {In this review we summarize recent insights into the development of human B cells primarily by studying immunodeficiencies. Development and differentiation of B cells can be considered as a paradigm for many other developmental processes in cell biology. However, it differs from the development of many other cell types by phases of extremely rapid cell division and by defined series of somatic recombination and mutation events required to assemble and refine the B cell antigen receptors. Both somatic DNA alteration and proliferation phases take place in defined sites but in different organs. Thus, cell migration and timely arrival at defined sites are additional features of B cell development. By comparing experimental mouse models with insights gained from studying defined genetic defects leading to primary immunodeficiencies and hypogammaglobulinemia, we address important features that are characteristic for human B cells. We also summarize recent advances made by developing improved in vitro and in vivo systems allowing the development of human B cells from hematopoietic stem cells. Combined with genetic and functional studies of immunodeficiencies, these models will contribute not only to a better understanding of disease affecting the B lymphocyte compartment, but also to designing better and safer novel B cell-targeted therapies in autoimmunity and allergy.},

abstract = {Interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene expression is highly up-regulated in canine hemangiosarcoma (HSA); however, its role in the pathogenesis of this disease is unknown. We investigated the expression of IL-8 in canine HSA tissues and cell lines, as well and the effects of IL-8 on canine HSA in vitro, and in vivo using a mouse xenograft model for the latter. Constitutive expression of IL-8 mRNA, IL-8 protein, and IL-8 receptor were variable among different tumor samples and cell lines, but they showed stable steady states in each cell line. Upon the addition of IL-8, HSA cells showed transient intracellular calcium fluxes, suggesting that their IL-8 receptors are functional and that IL-8 binding activates relevant signaling pathways. Yet, neither addition of exogenous IL-8 nor blockade of endogenous IL-8 by neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibody ($\alpha$-IL-8 Ab) affected HSA cell proliferation or survival in vitro. To assess potential effects of IL-8 in other tumor constituents, we stratified HSA cell lines and whole tumor samples into "IL-8 high" and "IL-8 low" groups. Genome-wide gene expression profiling showed that samples in the "IL-8 high" tumor group were enriched for genes associated with a "reactive microenvironment," including activation of coagulation, inflammation, and fibrosis networks. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the effects of IL-8 on these tumors were mostly indirect, regulating interactions with the microenvironment. This hypothesis was supported by in vivo xenograft experiments where survival and engraftment of tumor cells was inhibited by administration of neutralizing $\alpha$-IL-8 Ab. Together, our results suggest that IL-8 contributes to establishing a permissive microenvironment during the early stages of tumorigenesis in HSA. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Reproduction is a risky affair; a lifespan cost of maintaining reproductive capability, and of reproduction itself, has been demonstrated in a wide range of animal species. However, little is understood about the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Most cost-of-reproduction studies simply ask how reproduction influences age at death, but are blind to the subjects' actual causes of death. Lifespan is a composite variable of myriad causes of death and it has not been clear whether the consequences of reproduction or of reproductive capability influence all causes of death equally. To address this gap in understanding, we compared causes of death among over 40,000 sterilized and reproductively intact domestic dogs, Canis lupus familiaris. We found that sterilization was strongly associated with an increase in lifespan, and while it decreased risk of death from some causes, such as infectious disease, it actually increased risk of death from others, such as cancer. These findings suggest that to understand how reproduction affects lifespan, a shift in research focus is needed. Beyond the impact of reproduction on when individuals die, we must investigate its impact on why individuals die, and subsequently must identify the mechanisms by which these causes of death are influenced by the physiology associated with reproductive capability. Such an approach may also clarify the effects of reproduction on lifespan in people.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that estrogen withdrawal by gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRHa) induces osteocyte death via apoptosis in human bone. Although it is likely that the increase in osteocyte death via apoptosis was related to the loss of estrogen, these experiments could not rule out a direct role for the GnRHa. Therefore, in this study, we have used a rat model of ovariectomy (OVX) to determine whether the effect of estrogen withdrawal extends to other species and to clarify the role of estrogen in the maintenance of osteocyte viability. Twelve 9-week-old rats were divided into three treatment groups: sham operated (SHAM) (n = 4), OVX (n = 4), and OVX + estrogen (E2) (25 microg/day) (n = 4). At 3 weeks following the start of treatment, tibial bones were removed. The percentage of osteocytes displaying DNA breaks, using an in situ nick-translation method, was significantly higher in the OVX group compared with the SHAM control in both cortical bone (10.04{\%} vs. 2.31{\%}, respectively; p {\textless} 0.0001) and trabecular bone (6.44{\%} vs. 1.58{\%}, respectively; p = 0.003). Addition of estrogen in the OVX animals completely abrogated the increase in osteocyte apoptosis in cortical bone (0.78{\%}) and trabecular bone (1.17{\%}). The percentage of apoptotic osteocytes decreased with increasing distance from the primary/secondary spongiosa interface below the growth plate in the OVX model and the OVX + E2 model. Nuclear morphology and electrophoresis of DNA confirmed the presence of apoptotic cells in the samples. In conclusion, OVX in the rat results in an increase in osteocyte apoptosis as a direct or indirect result of E2 loss. Addition of estrogen in the OVX animals prevents this increase in osteocyte apoptosis. These data confirm an important role for estrogen in the control of osteocyte apoptosis and the maintenance of osteocyte viability. Estrogen deficiency might, through compromising the viability of osteocyte networks, reduce the ability of bone to respond appropriately to loading.},

In this study, we tried to demonstrate the heterogeneity of EPC. METHODS AND RESULTS: We cultured total mononuclear cells from human peripheral blood to get two types of EPC sequentially from the same donors. We called them early EPC and late EPC. Early EPC with spindle shape showed peak growth at 2 to 3 weeks and died at 4 weeks, whereas late EPC with cobblestone shape appeared late at 2 to 3 weeks, showed exponential growth at 4 to 8 weeks, and lived up to 12 weeks. Late EPC was different from early EPC in the expression of VE-cadherin, Flt-1, KDR, and CD45. Late EPC produced more nitric oxide, incorporated more readily into human umbilical vein endothelial cells monolayer, and formed capillary tube better than early EPC. Early EPC secreted angiogenic cytokines (vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin 8) more so than late EPC during culture in vitro. Both types of EPC showed comparable in vivo vasculogenic capacity. CONCLUSIONS: We found two types of EPC from a source of adult peripheral blood that might have different roles in neovasculogenesis based on the identified differences.},

These include co-factors with the potential to regulate histone modifications such as acetylation or methylation, and therefore the transcriptional state of target genes. Although much of the information regarding the interaction of specific co-factors with ER has been generated by studying specific promoter regions, we now have an improved understanding of the nature of these interactions and are better placed to relate these with ER activity and potentially with the activity of breast cancer drugs, including tamoxifen.},

Although the aetiology of most cancers is likely to be multifactorial, the limited genetic diversity seen in purebred dogs facilitates genetic linkage or association studies on relatively small populations as compared to humans, and by using newly developed resources, genome-wide association studies in dog breeds are proving to be a powerful tool for unravelling complex disorders. This paper will review the literature on canine breed susceptibility to histiocytic sarcoma, osteosarcoma, haemangiosarcoma, mast cell tumours, lymphoma, melanoma, and mammary tumours including the recent advances in knowledge through molecular genetic, cytogenetic, and genome wide association studies.},

abstract = {Canine histiocytic malignancies (HM) are aggressive tumors that occur with particularly high frequency in certain breeds including Bernese mountain dogs and flat-coated retrievers. Robust diagnosis of HM commonly utilizes immunohistochemical stains that are broadly ineffective on formalin-fixed tissues; thus the diagnosis is often one of exclusion. Clinical outcomes are generally poor, with frequent metastasis and therapeutic failure lowering overall survival at time of diagnosis to an average of less than two months in the majority of published work. The limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlyingHMhas hindered the development of more effective diagnostic modalities and the identification of therapeutic targets. A potential avenue exists for advancing clinical management of canine cancers through extrapolation from a close counterpart in human medicine. Historically, HM have been compared to the rare and understudied subset of human cancers involving the dendritic lineage, such as dendritic cell sarcoma or Langerhans cell sarcoma. Recent data have now thrown into question the cellular origin of HM, suggesting that the disease may originate from the macrophage lineage. This review summarizes existing knowledge of HM from the clinical, histologic and molecular perspectives, and highlights avenues for future research that may aid the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In turn, a more advanced appreciation of the mechanisms underlying HM should clarify their cellular origin and identify appropriate opportunities for synergistic extrapolation between related canine and human cancers.},

abstract = {Background: One of the most common diseases in intact bitches is pyometra– a potentially life-threatening disease associated with a variety of clinical and laboratory findings. The aims of the present study were to describe complications of the disease and to investigate clinically useful indicators associated with peritonitis and/or prolonged postoperative hospitalization. Results: A retrospective study was performed using records from 356 bitches diagnosed with pyometra during the years Of the 356 bitches, 315 were surgically treated by ovariohysterectomy, 9 were medically treated and 32 were euthanized without treatment. In the surgically treated bitches, univariable associations between clinical and laboratory data, risk for prolonged hospitalization (≥ 3 days) and/or signs of peritonitis, were analyzed by Chi-square and Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression models were used to assess multivariable associations. The most common complication observed in surgically treated bitches was peritonitis (40 bitches), followed by urinary tract infection (19 bitches), wound infection (8 bitches), uveitis (6 bitches), and cardiac arrhythmia (5 bitches). Leucopenia and fever/hypothermia were associated with increased risk for peritonitis (18-fold and three-fold, respectively). Moderate to severe depression of the general condition, pale mucous membranes and leucopenia were associated with increased risk (seven-fold, three-fold, and over three-point-five-fold, respectively) for prolonged postoperative hospitalization. Conclusions: Several clinically useful indicators were identified. Leucopenia was the most important marker, associated with 18-fold increased risk for peritonitis and an over three-point-five increased risk for prolonged hospitalization. Fever/hypothermia, depression and pale mucous membranes were associated with increased risk for peritonitis and/or prolonged hospitalization. The results of the present study may be valuable for identifying peritonitis and predicting increased morbidity in surgically treated bitches with pyometra.},

abstract = {Progestin withdrawal is a crucial event for the onset of labor in many mammalian species. However, in humans the mechanism of a functional progestin withdrawal is unclear, because progestin concentrations do not drop in maternal plasma preceding labor. We report the presence of two novel functional membrane progestin receptors (mPRs), mPRalpha and mPRbeta, in human myometrium that are differentially modulated during labor and by steroids in vitro. The mPRs are coupled to inhibitory G proteins, resulting in a decline in cAMP levels and increased phosphorylation of myosin light chain, both of which facilitate myometrial contraction. Activation of mPRs leads to transactivation of PR-B, the first evidence for cross-talk between membrane and nuclear PRs. Progesterone activation of the mPRs leads also to a decrease of the steroid receptor coactivator 2. Our data indicate the presence of a novel signaling pathway mediated by mPRs that may result in a functional progestin withdrawal, shifting the balance from a quiescent state to one of contraction.},

abstract = {Summary Non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) causes many deaths worldwide, and its incidence is increasing. Although some cases are associated with immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, or viral infections, in most cases the causes of NHL are not understood. However, there have been some important advances in our understanding of the development of healthy lymphocytes and the pathogenesis of NHL over the past 10 years. These advances have been accompanied by an improvement in treatment for NHL. Before the late 1990s, the only treatment option available was cytotoxic chemotherapy. In the past 10 years, however, high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell reconstitution have become established parts of treatment for aggressive lymphoma. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies have become another therapeutic option. Rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) is the most advanced monoclonal antibody in clinical trials and has become part of standard treatment for some lymphomas. Rituximab, and many other monoclonal antibodies, continue to be assessed in clinical studies. Monoclonal antibodies can be used alone or in combination with standard-dose or high-dose chemotherapy, and they can also be conjugated to radionuclides to enhance cytotoxicity. Here, we review advances in the treatment of NHL that have occurred over the past 10 years.},

abstract = {Abstract It is now widely recognized that epigenetic events are important mechanisms underlying cancer development and progression. Epigenetic information in chromatin includes covalent modifications (such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination) of core nucleosomal proteins (histones). A recent progress in the field of histone modifications and chromatin research has tremendously enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the control of key physiological and pathological processes. Histone modifications and other epigenetic mechanisms appear to work together in establishing and maintaining gene activity states, thus regulating a wide range of cellular processes. Different histone modifications themselves act in a coordinated and orderly fashion to regulate cellular processes such as gene transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Interest in histone modifications has further grown over the last decade with the discovery and characterization of a large number of histone-modifying molecules and protein complexes. Alterations in the function of histone-modifying complexes are believed to disrupt the pattern and levels of histone marks and consequently deregulate the control of chromatin-based processes, ultimately leading to oncogenic transformation and the development of cancer. Consistent with this notion, aberrant patterns of histone modifications have been associated with a large number of human malignancies. In this chapter, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the establishment and maintenance of histone marks and how disruptions of these chromatin-based mechanisms contribute to tumorigenesis. We also suggest how these advances may facilitate the development of novel strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat human malignancies.},

In addition, mutations in the p53 gene were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-stranded conformation polymorphism and PCR direct sequencing; furthermore, we quantified cyclin D1 mRNA by semiquantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Positive immunoreactivity for p53 was observed in 17.9{\%} of HSAs. However, mutations were not detected in these cases. The labeling indices for Rb, phospho-Rb, and cyclin D1 were markedly higher in all HSAs than in hemangiomas. Of the 7 cases with cyclin D1-positive immunoreactivity, 4 overexpressed cyclin D1 mRNA (to a level more than 10-fold higher than that of GAPDH mRNA). The p16 protein was clearly detected in all hemangiomas; however, 82{\%} of the neoplastic cells in HSA showed a loss of or low immunoreactivity. These results suggest that alteration of the p16-cyclin D1-Rb pathway, rather than the p53 pathway, may be associated with the pathogenesis of canine HSA.},

Canine B-cell lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma are both malignancies of the hematologic system that are clinically and histologically similar to human B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and angiosarcoma, respectively. Golden retrievers in the US show significantly elevated lifetime risk for both B-cell lymphoma (6{\%}) and hemangiosarcoma (20{\%}). We conducted genome-wide association studies for hemangiosarcoma and B-cell lymphoma, identifying two shared predisposing loci. The two associated loci are located on chromosome 5, and together contribute {\~{}}20{\%} of the risk of developing these cancers. Genome-wide p-values for the top SNP of each locus are 4.6×10-7 and 2.7×10-6, respectively. Whole genome resequencing of nine cases and controls followed by genotyping and detailed analysis identified three shared and one B-cell lymphoma specific risk haplotypes within the two loci, but no coding changes were associated with the risk haplotypes. Gene expression analysis of B-cell lymphoma tumors revealed that carrying the risk haplotypes at the first locus is associated with down-regulation of several nearby genes including the proximal gene TRPC6, a transient receptor Ca2+-channel involved in T-cell activation, among other functions. The shared risk haplotype in the second locus overlaps the vesicle transport and release gene STX8. Carrying the shared risk haplotype is associated with gene expression changes of 100 genes enriched for pathways involved in immune cell activation. Thus, the predisposing germ-line mutations in B-cell lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma appear to be regulatory, and affect pathways involved in T-cell mediated immune response in the tumor. This suggests that the interaction between the immune system and malignant cells plays a common role in the tumorigenesis of these relatively different cancers.},

abstract = {Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a multifunctional growth factor that can stimulate cell proliferation, production of proteases, and angiogenesis. Loss of mechanisms that regulate bFGF activity could result in tumor development. To test this idea, cells derived from an invasive bladder carcinoma (EJ) were compared with cells derived from a noninvasive bladder carcinoma (RT4) for the expression of bFGF and high and low affinity FGF receptors. bFGF was produced by the invasive EJ cells but not by the noninvasive RT4 cells, suggesting that bFGF could act in an autocrine fashion in the EJ cells to promote their invasion and growth in the surrounding tissue. The two cells lines also showed differences in FGF receptor expression. The EJ cells expressed both high and low affinity FGF receptors as determined by Scatchard analysis, whereas the RT4 cells expressed only high affinity receptors. The high affinity receptors on the RT4 cells were not recognized by an antibody to known FGF receptors. Furthermore, in contrast to the EJ cells, bFGF did not induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the RT4 cells. Thus these data suggest that the invasive potential of bladder carcinoma cells may be regulated by the expression of both bFGF and its receptors.},

These niches maintain the principle properties of CSCs, preserve their phenotypic plasticity, protect them from the immune system, and facilitate their metastatic potential.

Also in breast cancer, the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women, this heterogeneity complicates the understanding of the stepwise sequence of pathogenic events and the design of effective and long-lasting target therapies. To disentangle this complexity and pinpoint which molecular perturbations are crucial to hijack the cellular machinery and lead to tumorigenesis and drug resistance, functional studies are needed in model systems that faithfully and comprehensively recapitulate all the salient aspects of their cognate human counterparts. Mouse models of breast cancer have been instrumental for the study of tumor initiation and drug response but also involve cost and time limitations that represent serious bottlenecks in translational research. To keep pace with the overwhelming amount of hypotheses that warrant in vivo testing, continuous refinement of current breast cancer models and implementation of new technologies is crucial. In this review, we summarize the current state of the art in modeling human breast cancer in mice, and we put forward our vision for future developments.},

There were over 260,000 female dogs with over 1,000,000 dog-years at risk (DYAR) in the database, using data on bitches up to 10 years of age and 110 breeds with over 1000 DYAR. In total, 20 423 bitches were diagnosed with pyometra and 11,758 with MTs and 30,131 with either or both of the two diseases. The incidence rate (IR) for pyometra was 199 (95{\%} CI 196-202), for MTs 112 (95{\%} CI 110-114) and for either or both of the two diseases 297 (95{\%} CI 294-301) dogs per 10,000 DYAR. The mean age of diagnosis pyometra was 7.0 years (SD ± 2.2), MTs 8.0 years (SD ± 1.6). In all breeds, the overall proportion of the bitches that developed disease by 10 years of age was for pyometra 19{\%}, MTs 13{\%}, and either or both of two diseases 30{\%}. The top 10 breeds diagnosed with either or both of the two diseases were the Leonberger (73{\%}), Irish Wolfhound (69{\%}), Bernese Mountain Dog (69{\%}), Great Dane (68{\%}), Staffordshire Bull Terrier (66{\%}), Rottweiler (65{\%}), Bullterrier (62{\%}), Doberman (62{\%}), Bouvier des Flandres (60{\%}), Airdaleterrier (60{\%}).

abstract = {Estrogens exert their physiological effects on target tissues by interacting with the estrogen receptors, ERalpha and ERbeta. Estrogen replacement is one the most common and effective strategies used to prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Whereas it was thought that estrogens work exclusively by inhibiting bone resorption, our previous results show that 17beta-estradiol (E2) increases mouse bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 mRNA, suggesting that estrogens may also enhance bone formation. In this study, we used quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis to demonstrate that estrogens increase BMP-2 mRNA in mouse mesenchymal stem cells. The selective ER modulators, tamoxifen, raloxifene, and ICI-182,780 (ICI), failed to enhance BMP-2 mRNA, whereas ICI inhibited E2 stimulation of expression. To investigate if estrogens increase BMP-2 expression by transcriptional mechanisms and if the response is mediated by ERalpha and/or ERbeta, we studied the effects of estrogens on BMP-2 promoter activity in transient transfected C3H10T1/2 cells. E2 produced a dose-dependent induction of the mouse -2712 BMP-2 promoter activity in cells cotransfected with ERalpha and ERbeta. At a dose of 10 nM E2, ERalpha induced mouse BMP-2 promoter activity 9-fold, whereas a 3-fold increase was observed in cells cotransfected with ERbeta. Tamoxifen and raloxifene were weak activators of the mouse BMP-2 promoter via ERalpha, but not via ERbeta. ICI blocked the activation of BMP-2 promoter activity by E2 acting via both ERalpha and ERbeta, indicating that mouse BMP-2 promoter activation is ER dependent. In contrast to E2 and selective ER modulators, the phytoestrogen, genistein was more effective at activating the mouse BMP-2 promoter with ERbeta, compared with ERalpha. Using a deletion series of the BMP-2 promoter, we determined that AP-1 or Sp1 sites are not required for E2 activation. A mutation in a sequence at -415 to -402 (5'-GGGCCActcTGACCC-3') that resembles the classical estrogen-responsive element abolished the activation of the BMP-2 promoter in response to E2. Our studies demonstrate that E2 activation of mouse BMP-2 gene transcription requires ERalpha or ERbeta acting via a variant estrogen-responsive element binding site in the promoter, with ERalpha being the more efficacious regulator. Estrogenic compounds may enhance bone formation by increasing the transcription of the BMP-2 gene.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In canine genetics, the impact of population structure on whole genome association studies is typically addressed by sampling approximately equal numbers of cases and controls from dogs of a single breed, usually from the same country or geographic area. However one way to increase the power of genetic studies is to sample individuals of the same breed but from different geographic areas, with the expectation that independent meiotic events will have shortened the presumed ancestral haplotype around the mutation differently. Little is known, however, about genetic variation among dogs of the same breed collected from different geographic regions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this report, we address the magnitude and impact of genetic diversity among common breeds sampled in the U.S. and Europe. The breeds selected, including the Rottweiler, Bernese mountain dog, flat-coated retriever, and golden retriever, share susceptibility to a class of soft tissue cancers typified by malignant histiocytosis in the Bernese mountain dog. We genotyped 722 SNPs at four unlinked loci (between 95 and 271 per locus) on canine chromosome 1 (CFA1). We showed that each population is characterized by distinct genetic diversity that can be correlated with breed history. When the breed studied has a reduced intra-breed diversity, the combination of dogs from international locations does not increase the rate of false positives and potentially increases the power of association studies. However, over-sampling cases from one geographic location is more likely to lead to false positive results in breeds with significant genetic diversity. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide new guidelines for association studies using purebred dogs that take into account population structure.},

The aim of this study was to determine if EBV is present in other canine populations, whether infection is associated with lymphoma in dogs, and whether infection is present in cats. Canine and feline serum samples were analysed by immunofluorescence assay. Antibodies to EBV or an EBV-like virus were detected in 38.4{\%} of UK dog sera, 64{\%} of US dog sera and 38{\%} of cat sera. Canine blood samples, tissue samples from the palatine tonsil and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy samples from canine lymphoma cases were analysed by PCR. Using EBV-specific primers, EBV was detected in one tonsil sample, whereas all other samples tested were negative. PCR using consensus herpesvirus primers identified canine herpesvirus in twelve tonsil samples and one biopsy but no gammaherpesviruses were detected. Canine blood samples from EBV antibody-positive dogs were analysed by RT-PCR to determine if transcripts associated with lytic EBV infection (BcLF1) or latency (LMP2) were present, however all samples tested were negative. In conclusion, there is serological evidence of exposure to EBV or an EBV-like virus in dogs and cats but persistent infection in the canine palatine tonsil is rare and no evidence was found of EBV in canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The effect of EBV on canine and feline cells and the possible outcome of the infection for the host require further investigation. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Identifying loci under natural selection from genomic surveys is of great interest in different research areas. Commonly used methods to separate neutral effects from adaptive effects are based on locus-specific population differentiation coefficients to identify outliers. Here we extend such an approach to estimate directly the probability that each locus is subject to selection using a Bayesian method. We also extend it to allow the use of dominant markers like AFLPs. It has been shown that this model is robust to complex demographic scenarios for neutral genetic differentiation. Here we show that the inclusion of isolated populations that underwent a strong bottleneck can lead to a high rate of false positives. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to avoid them by carefully choosing the populations that should be included in the analysis. We analyze two previously published data sets: a human data set of codominant markers and a Littorina saxatilis data set of dominant markers. We also perform a detailed sensitivity study to compare the power of the method using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), SNP, and microsatellite markers.

Given the recent study that in the heart, estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is involved in adaptive mechanisms by supporting cardiomyocytes survival via post-infarct cardiac c-kit+ cells, we tested a novel hypothesis that membrane ERalpha (mERsmall a, Cyrillic) supports survival of BM c-kit+ cells and enhance protective paracrine function for cardiac repair. Our data showed that myocardial infarction (MI) leads to an increase in c-kit+ first in bone marrow and then specifically within the infarcted myocardium. Also up-regulated mERsmall a, Cyrillic in post-infarct BM c-kit+ cells was found in day 3 post MI. In vitro co-culture system, mERsmall a, Cyrillic+ enhances the beneficial effects of BM c-kit+ cells by increasing their viability and reducing apoptosis. Post-infarct c-kit+ mERsmall a, Cyrillic+ cells population expresses predominant ERalpha and holds self-renewal as well as cardiac differentiation potentials after MI. In vivo, BM c-kit+ cells reduced infarct size, fibrosis and improved cardiac function. In conclusion, BM c-kit+ mERsmall a, Cyrillic+ exerted significantly cardiac protection after MI. A potential important implication of this study is that the manipulation of BM c-kit+ stem cells with ERsmall a, Cyrillic-dependent fashion may be helpful in recovering functional performance after cardiac tissue injury.},

abstract = {Precision oncology is predicated upon the ability to detect specific actionable genomic alterations and to monitor their adaptive evolution during treatment to counter resistance. Because of spatial and temporal heterogeneity and comorbidities associated with obtaining tumor tissues, especially in the case of metastatic disease, traditional methods for tumor sampling are impractical for this application. Known to be present in the blood of cancer patients for decades, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is beginning to inform on tumor genetics, tumor burden, and mechanisms of progression and drug resistance. This substrate is amenable for inexpensive noninvasive testing and thus presents a viable approach to serial sampling for screening and monitoring tumor progression. The fragmentation, low yield, and variable admixture of normal DNA present formidable technical challenges for realization of this potential. This review summarizes the history of cfDNA discovery, its biological properties, and explores emerging technologies for clinically relevant sequence-based analysis of cfDNA in cancer patients. Molecular barcoding (or Unique Molecular Identifier, UMI)-based methods currently appear to offer an optimal balance between sensitivity, flexibility, and cost and constitute a promising approach for clinically relevant assays for near real-time monitoring of treatment-induced mutational adaptations to guide evidence-based precision oncology.

abstract = {Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare human genetic disease characterized by bone marrow failure, cancer predisposition, and genomic instability. It has been known for many years that FA patient-derived cells are exquisitely sensitive to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents such as cisplatin and mitomycin C. On this basis, it was widely assumed that failure to repair endogenous interstrand cross-links (ICLs) causes FA, although the endogenous mutagen that generates these lesions remained elusive. Recent genetic evidence now suggests that endogenous aldehydes are the driving force behind FA. Importantly, aldehydes cause a variety of DNA lesions, including ICLs and DNA protein cross-links (DPCs), re-kindling the debate about which DNA lesions cause FA. In this review, we discuss new developments in our understanding of DPC and ICL repair, and how these findings bear on the question of which DNA lesion underlies FA.},

abstract = {Activating mutations of the BRAF gene lead to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. Although many human cancers carry the mutated BRAF gene, this mutation has not yet been characterized in canine cancers. As human and canine cancers share molecular abnormalities, we hypothesized that BRAF gene mutations also exist in canine cancers. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced the exon 15 of BRAF, mutation hot spot of the gene, in 667 canine primary tumors and 38 control tissues. Sequencing analysis revealed that a single nucleotide T to A transversion at nucleotide 1349 occurred in 64 primary tumors (9.6{\%}), with particularly high frequency in prostatic carcinoma (20/25, 80{\%}) and urothelial carcinoma (30/45, 67{\%}). This mutation results in the amino acid substitution of glutamic acid for valine at codon 450 (V450E) of canine BRAF, corresponding to the most common BRAF mutation in human cancer, V600E. The evolutional conservation of the BRAF V600E mutation highlights the importance of MAPK pathway activation in neoplasia and may offer opportunity for molecular diagnostics and targeted therapeutics for dogs bearing BRAF-mutated cancers.},

abstract = {Patellar luxation is an orthopedic disorder in which the patella moves out of its normal location within the femoral trochlea of the knee and it can lead to osteoarthritis, lameness, and pain. In dogs it is a heritable trait, with both environmental and genetic factors contributing to the phenotype. The prevalence of patellar luxation in the Dutch Flat-Coated Retriever population is 24{\%}. In this study, we investigated the molecular genetics of the disorder in this population. Genome-wide association analysis of 15,823 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 45 cases and 40 controls revealed that patellar luxation was significantly associated with a region on chromosome CFA07, and possibly with regions on CFA03, CFA31, and CFA36. The exons of the genes in these regions, 0.5 Mb combined, were analyzed further. These exons from 15 cases and a pooled sample from 15 controls were enriched using custom genomic hybridization arrays and analyzed by massive parallel DNA sequencing. In total 7257 variations were detected. Subsequently, a selection of 144 of these SNPs were genotyped in 95 Flat-Coated Retrievers. Nine SNPs, in eight genes on CFA07 and CFA31, were associated with patellar luxation (P {\textless}10-4). Genotyping of these SNPs in samples from a variety of breeds revealed that the disease-associated allele of one synonymous SNP in a pseudogene of FMO6 was unique to Flat-Coated Retrievers. Genome-wide association analysis followed by targeted DNA sequencing identified loci on chromosomes 7 and 31 as being involved in patellar luxation in the Flat-Coated Retriever breed.},

abstract = {Identifying loci under natural selection from genomic surveys is of great interest in different research areas. Commonly used methods to separate neutral effects from adaptive effects are based on locus-specific population differentiation coefficients to identify outliers. Here we extend such an approach to estimate directly the probability that each locus is subject to selection using a Bayesian method. We also extend it to allow the use of dominant markers like AFLPs. It has been shown that this model is robust to complex demographic scenarios for neutral genetic differentiation. Here we show that the inclusion of isolated populations that underwent a strong bottleneck can lead to a high rate of false positives. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to avoid them by carefully choosing the populations that should be included in the analysis. We analyze two previously published data sets: a human data set of codominant markers and a Littorina saxatilis data set of dominant markers. We also perform a detailed sensitivity study to compare the power of the method using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), SNP, and microsatellite markers. The method has been implemented in a new software available at our website (http://www-leca.ujf-grenoble.fr/logiciels.htm).},

abstract = {Germ-line and somatic mutations in genes that promote homology-directed repair (HDR), especially BRCA1 and BRCA2, are frequently observed in several cancers, in particular, breast and ovary but also prostate and other cancers. HDR is critical for the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other lesions, and HDR factors also protect stalled replication forks. As a result, loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 poses significant risks to genome integrity, leading not only to cancer predisposition but also to sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, affecting therapeutic approaches. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2, including how they genetically interact with other repair factors, how they protect stalled replication forks, how they affect the response to aldehydes, and how loss of their functions links to mutation signatures. Importantly, given the recent advances with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) for the treatment of HDR-deficient tumors, we discuss mechanisms by which BRCA-deficient tumors acquire resistance to PARPi and other agents.},

abstract = {Background. In canine genetics, the impact of population structure on whole genome association studies is typically addressed by sampling approximately equal numbers of cases and controls from dogs of a single breed, usually from the same country or geographic area. However one way to increase the power of genetic studies is to sample individuals of the same breed but from different geographic areas, with the expectation that independent meiotic events will have shortened the presumed ancestral haplotype around the mutation differently. Little is known, however, about genetic variation among dogs of the same breed collected from different geographic regions. Methodology/Principal Findings. In this report, we address the magnitude and impact of genetic diversity among common breeds sampled in the U.S. and Europe. The breeds selected, including the Rottweiler, Bernese mountain dog, flat-coated retriever, and golden retriever, share susceptibility to a class of soft tissue cancers typified by malignant histiocytosis in the Bernese mountain dog. We genotyped 722 SNPs at four unlinked loci (between 95 and 271 per locus) on canine chromosome 1 (CFA1). We showed that each population is characterized by distinct genetic diversity that can be correlated with breed history. When the breed studied has a reduced intra-breed diversity, the combination of dogs from international locations does not increase the rate of false positives and potentially increases the power of association studies. However, over-sampling cases from one geographic location is more likely to lead to false positive results in breeds with significant genetic diversity. Conclusions. These data provide new guidelines for association studies using purebred dogs that take into account population structure. {\textcopyright} 2007 Quignon et al.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in human blood, most studies have focused on diagnostic and prognostic uses of these markers for solid tumors. Except for some prenatal tests and BEAMing, cfDNA analysis has not yet been translated to clinical practice and routine application appears distant. This can be attributed to overlapping factors: (i) a lack of knowledge regarding the origin and function of cfDNA, (ii) insufficient molecular characterization, and (iii) the absence of an analytical consensus. In this review, we address the latter determinant and focus specifically on quantitative analysis of cfDNA. While the literature reports limited value for a single quantitative assessment, cfDNA kinetic assessment will be an essential component to qualitative characterization. In order to establish quantitative analysis for accurate kinetic assessments, process optimization and standardization are crucial. This report elucidates the most confounding variables of each preanalytic step that must be considered for optimal analysis.},

The precise timing and location of this event is debated and little is known about the genetic changes that accompanied the transformation of ancient wolves into domestic dogs. Here we conduct whole-genome resequencing of dogs and wolves to identify 3.8 million genetic variants used to identify 36 genomic regions that probably represent targets for selection during dog domestication. Nineteen of these regions contain genes important in brain function, eight of which belong to nervous system development pathways and potentially underlie behavioural changes central to dog domestication. Ten genes with key roles in starch digestion and fat metabolism also show signals of selection. We identify candidate mutations in key genes and provide functional support for an increased starch digestion in dogs relative to wolves. Our results indicate that novel adaptations allowing the early ancestors of modern dogs to thrive on a diet rich in starch, relative to the carnivorous diet of wolves, constituted a crucial step in the early domestication of dogs. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Considerable clinical and molecular variations have been known in retinal blinding diseases in man and also in dogs. Different forms of retinal diseases occur in specific breed(s) caused by mutations segregating within each isolated breeding population. While molecular studies to find genes and mutations underlying retinal diseases in dogs have benefited largely from the phenotypic and genetic uniformity within a breed, within- and across-breed variations have often played a key role in elucidating the molecular basis. The increasing knowledge of phenotypic, allelic, and genetic heterogeneities in canine retinal degeneration has shown that the overall picture is rather more complicated than initially thought. Over the past 20 years, various approaches have been developed and tested to search for genes and mutations underlying genetic traits in dogs, depending on the availability of genetic tools and sample resources. Candidate gene, linkage analysis, and genome-wide association studies have so far identified 24 mutations in 18 genes underlying retinal diseases in at least 58 dog breeds. Many of these genes have been associated with retinal diseases in humans, thus providing opportunities to study the role in pathogenesis and in normal vision. Application in therapeutic interventions such as gene therapy has proven successful initially in a naturally occurring dog model followed by trials in human patients. Other genes whose human homologs have not been associated with retinal diseases are potential candidates to explain equivalent human diseases and contribute to the understanding of their function in vision. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) represents a group of malignant canine tumors to which Bernese Mountain Dogs (BMD) and Flatcoated Retrievers (FCR) are predisposed. The differential diagnosis for HS is broad, encompassing round cell tumors, sarcomas and other histiocytic diseases. The aim of this study was to establish morphological and immunohistochemical criteria for routine use on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples and cytological smears for the recognition and differentiation of canine HS and its subtypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospectively, tumor sections were reviewed from 449 BMD and 380 FCR with confirmed or suspected HS, other histiocytic conditions, or a disease of the differential diagnosis of HS. RESULTS In a large proportion of cases, 47.5{\%} for histology and for 46.3{\%} cytology, the initial diagnosis was changed after the revision process. A large variation in morphological features of HS was observed in this study, making the existence of several subtypes in dogs also very likely. Furthermore, the different percentage of morphological features between BMD and FCR indicates the different mixture of cell type origins resulting possibly from genetic or environmental differences at the onset of HS in those breeds. CONCLUSION This study stresses the value of a strictly applied and standardized scoring system for microscopic evaluation of tumor sections and smears, and the implementation of review and revision of pathological diagnoses.},

abstract = {Wright's F-statistics, and especially F ST , provide important insights into the evolutionary processes that influence the structure of genetic variation within and among populations, and they are among the most widely used descriptive statistics in population and evolutionary genetics. Estimates of F ST can identify regions of the genome that have been the target of selection, and comparisons of F ST from different parts of the genome can provide insights into the demographic history of populations. For these reasons and others, F ST has a central role in population and evolutionary genetics and has wide applications in fields that range from disease association mapping to forensic science. This Review clarifies how F ST is defined, how it should be estimated, how it is related to similar statistics and how estimates of F ST should be interpreted. Nearly every plant or animal species includes many partially isolated populations. As a result of genetic drift or divergent natural selection, such populations become genetically differentiated over time. For example, recent analyses based on more than 370 FURTHER INFORMATION Kent E.

abstract = {Objectives: To study the ability of a stabilizing reagent to prevent cellular DNA contamination of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma during whole blood sample storage and shipping. Design and methods: Samples were drawn from healthy donors into K3EDTA and Cell-Free DNA BCTs (BCT) and stored at room temperature (RT). Aliquots were removed at specified time points and cfDNA was purified from the plasma. A Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) assay that amplifies a short $\beta$-actin gene fragment (136bp) was used to measure the total plasma cfDNA (pDNA) concentration while a longer $\beta$-actin fragment (420bp) was used to quantify genomic DNA (gDNA). In a follow-up experiment, blood samples drawn into the same types of tubes were shipped round trip by overnight air before cfDNA was isolated and analyzed. Results: Blood stored in K3EDTA tubes at RT showed increases in pDNA and gDNA concentrations over time. However, both pDNA and gDNA levels remained stable in BCT for at least seven days. On day 14, there was a 4.5-fold increase in pDNA in BCT as compared to {\textgreater}200-fold increase in K3EDTA tubes. Likewise, gDNA increased {\textless}2-fold on day 14 in BCT as opposed to a 456-fold increase in K3EDTA tubes. Similar results were observed after samples were shipped. Conclusions: Cell-Free DNA BCTs prevent gDNA contamination that may occur due to nucleated cell disruption during sample storage and shipping. This novel blood collection tube provides a method for obtaining stable cfDNA samples for rare target detection and accurate analysis while mitigating the threat of gDNA contamination. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Domestic dogs are unique from other animal models of cancer in that they generally experience spontaneous disease. In addition, most types of cancer observed in humans are found in dogs, suggesting that canines may be an informative system for the study of cancer genetics. Domestic dogs are divided into over 175 breeds, with members of each breed sharing significant phenotypes. The breed barrier enhances the utility of the model, especially for genetic studies where small numbers of genes are hypothesized to account for the breed cancer susceptibility. These facts, combined with recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies allows for an unrivaled ability to use pet dog populations to find often subtle mutations that promote cancer susceptibility and progression in dogs as a whole. The meticulous record keeping associated with dog breeding makes the model still more powerful, as it facilitates both association analysis and family-based linkage studies. Key to the success of these studies is their cooperative nature, with owners, scientists, veterinarians and breed clubs working together to avoid the cost and unpopularity of developing captive populations. In this article we explore these principals and advocate for colony-free, genetic studies that will enhance our ability to diagnose and treat cancer in dogs and humans alike.},

To identify the genetic underpinnings of such traits, we analyze 722 canine whole genome sequences (WGS), documenting over 91 million single nucleotide and small indels, creating a large catalog of genomic variation for a companion animal species. We undertake both selective sweep analyses and genome wide association studies (GWAS) inclusive of over 144 modern breeds, 54 wild canids and a hundred village dogs. Our results identify variants of strong impact associated with 16 phenotypes, including body weight variation which, when combined with existing data, explain greater than 90{\%} of body size variation in dogs. We thus demonstrate that GWAS and selection scans performed with WGS are powerful complementary methods for expanding the utility of companion animal systems for the study of mammalian growth and biology.},

abstract = {During the last 15 years spectacular progress has been achieved in knowledge on the dog genome organization and the molecular background of hereditary diseases in this species. A majority of canine genetic diseases have their counterparts in humans and thus dogs are considered as a very important large animal model in human biomedicine. Among canine monogenic diseases with known causative gene mutations there are two large groups classified as retinal dystrophies and lysosomal storage diseases. Specific types of these diseases are usually diagnosed in a single or several breeds. A well known disorder, restricted to a single breed, is congenital stationary night blindness described in Briards. This disease is a counterpart of Leber amaurosis in children. On the other hand, one of the most common monogenic human diseases (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), has its canine counterparts in several breeds (e.g., the Golden retriever, Beagle and German short-haired pointer). For some of the canine diseases gene therapy strategy was successfully applied, e.g., for congenital stationary night blindness, rod-cone dystrophy and muccopolysaccharydoses type I, IIIB and VII. Since phenotypic variability between the breeds is exceptionally high, the dog is an interesting model to study the molecular background of congenital malformations (e.g., dwarfism and osteoporosis imperfecta). Also disorders of sexual development (DSD), especially testicular or ovotesticular DSD (78,XX; SRY-negative), which is widely distributed across dozens of breeds, are of particular interest. Studies on the genetic background of canine cancers, a major health problem in this species, are also quite advanced. On the other hand, genetic studies on canine counterparts of major human complex diseases (e.g., obesity, the metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus) are still in their infancy. {\textcopyright} 2014 Society for Biology of Reproduction {\&} the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn.},

The evaluation of patient-specific translocations in leukemias and lymphomas has revolutionized diagnostics for these diseases. We have developed a method, called personalized analysis of rearranged ends (PARE), which can identify translocations in solid tumors. Analysis of four colorectal and two breast cancers with massively parallel sequencing revealed an average of nine rearranged sequences (range, 4 to 15) per tumor. Polymerase chain reaction with primers spanning the breakpoints was able to detect mutant DNA molecules present at levels lower than 0.001{\%} and readily identified mutated circulating DNA in patient plasma samples. This approach provides an exquisitely sensitive and broadly applicable approach for the development of personalized biomarkers to enhance the clinical management of cancer patients.},

abstract = {Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most difficult cancers to treat with the poorest prognosis. The key to improving survival rates in this disease is early detection and monitoring of disseminated and residual disease. However, this is hindered due to lack reliable diagnostic and predictive markers which mean that the majority of patients succumb to their condition within a few months. We present a pilot study of the detection circulating free DNA (cfDNA) combined with tumor specific mutation detection by digital PCR as a novel minimally invasive biomarker in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This was compared to the detection of CTC by the CellSearch{\textregistered} system and a novel CTC enrichment strategy based on CD45 positive cell depletion. The aim of the study was to assess tumor specific DNA detection in plasma and CTC detection as prognostic markers in PDAC. We detected KRAS mutant cfDNA in 26 {\%} of patients of all stages and this correlated strongly with Overall Survival (OS), 60 days (95 {\%} CI: 19–317) for KRAS mutation positive vs 772 days for KRAS mutation negative (95 {\%} CI: 416–1127). Although, the presence of CTC detected by the CellSearch{\textregistered} system did correlate significantly with OS, 88 days (95 {\%} CI: 27–206) CTC positive vs 393 days CTC negative (95 {\%} CI: 284–501), CTC were detected in only 20 {\%} of patients, the majority of which had metastatic disease, whereas KRAS mutant cfDNA was detected in patients with both resectable and advanced disease. Tumor specific cfDNA detection and CTC detection are promising markers for the management of patients with PDAC, although there is a need to validate these results in a larger patient cohort and optimize the detection of CTC in PDAC by applying the appropriate markers for their detection.},

Although the aetiology of most cancers is likely to be multifactorial, the limited genetic diversity seen in purebred dogs facilitates genetic linkage or association studies on relatively small populations as compared to humans, and by using newly developed resources, genome-wide association studies in dog breeds are proving to be a powerful tool for unravelling complex disorders. This paper will review the literature on canine breed susceptibility to histiocytic sarcoma, osteosarcoma, haemangiosarcoma, mast cell tumours, lymphoma, melanoma, and mammary tumours including the recent advances in knowledge through molecular genetic, cytogenetic, and genome wide association studies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES
Circulating plasma DNA is being increasingly used for biomedical and clinical research as a substrate for genetic testing. However, cell lysis can occur hours after venipuncture when using standard tubes for blood collection, leading to an increase in contaminating cellular DNA that may hinder analysis of circulating plasma DNA. Cell stabilization agents can prevent cellular lysis for several days, reducing the need for immediate plasma preparation after venipuncture, thereby facilitating the ease of blood collection and sample preparation for clinical research. However, the majority of cell stabilizing reagents have not been formally tested for their ability to preserve circulating plasma tumor DNA. 

DESIGN {\&} METHODS
In this study, we compared the properties of two cell stabilizing reagents, the cell-free DNA BCT tube and the PAXgene tube, by collecting blood samples from metastatic breast cancer patients and measuring genome equivalents of plasma DNA by droplet digital PCR. We compared wild type PIK3CA genome equivalents and also assayed for two PIK3CA hotspot mutations, E545K and H1047R. 

RESULTS
Our results demonstrate that blood stored for 7days in BCT tubes did not show evidence of cell lysis, whereas PAXgene tubes showed an order of magnitude increase in genome equivalents, indicative of considerable cellular lysis. 

CONCLUSIONS
We conclude that BCT tubes can prevent lysis and cellular release of genomic DNA of blood samples from cancer patients when stored at room temperature, and could therefore be of benefit for blood specimen collections in clinical trials.},

abstract = {Objective: Many biomedical journals have introduced disclosure of research contribution in journal articles as a way to limit irresponsible authorship. Over the years, journals have developed different contribution disclosure policies and procedures, but it is not known how these policies and procedures affect authorship. The aim of our study was to analyse possible causative relationships between the structure of the contribution disclosure form and the number of authors who do not meet authorship criteria in biomedicine set by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). Research design and methods: In a single-blind randomized trial, 1462 authors of 332 manuscripts submitted to a general medical journal answered one of three different contribution disclosure forms: (1) open-ended - asking the respondents to describe in their own words their contributions in the submitted work; (2) categorical - with 11 possible contribution choices and (3) instructional - guiding through the ICMJE definition and instructing how many contributions are needed to satisfy individual criteria. Main outcome measure: The number of authors not satisfying ICMJE authorship criteria. Results: The group answering the instructional form had significantly fewer authors whose reported contributions did not satisfy ICMJE criteria (18.7{\%}) than the groups answering the categorical (62.8{\%}) or open-ended (54.7{\%}) form ($\chi$ 2 2 = 210.833, p {\textless} 0.001). The group receiving instructional forms also had the fewest articles with honorary authors (32.5{\%}) compared with those who responded in a categorical (68.7{\%}) or open-ended (83.0{\%}) form ($\chi$ 2 2 = 63.378, p {\textless} 0.001). All authors who answered the open-ended form, regardless of their compliance with authorship criteria, reported significantly fewer contributions (median 3 [95{\%} confidence interval = 3-3]) than authors responding to either the categorical (4 [4-4] ; zscore = -7.1899, p {\textless} 0.001) or instructional form (4 [4-5]; z score = -13.9760, p {\textless} 0.001). Honorary authors answering the instructional form reported more contributions than those answering either the categorical or open-ended form (z score = 2.7637, p = 0.0057 and z score = 3.3773, p {\textless} 0.001, respectively). Most honorary authors (39.9{\%}) lacked only the third ICMJE criterion (final approval of the submitted manuscript). Conclusions: The structure of the contribution disclosure form significantly influenced the number of contributions reported by authors of submitted manuscripts and their compliance with the ICMJE authorship criteria. Journal editors should be aware of the cognitive aspects of survey methodology when they construct for their authors self-reports about behaviour, such as contribution disclosure forms. {\textcopyright} 2006 Librapharm Limited.},

abstract = {A 4-bp deletion mutation associated with multiple drug sensitivity exists in the canine multidrug resistance (MDR1) gene. This mutation has been detected in more than 10 purebred dog breeds as well as in mixed breed dogs. To evaluate the breed distribution of this mutation in Germany, 7378 dogs were screened, including 6999 purebred and 379 mixed breed dogs. The study included dog breeds that show close genetic relationship or share breeding history with one of the predisposed breeds but in which the occurrence of the MDR1 mutation has not been reported. MDR1 allele of 59{\%}, 45{\%}, 30{\%}, 24{\%}, 22{\%}, 17{\%}, 14{\%}, 4{\%} and 1{\%}, respectively. Allelic frequencies of 8{\%} and 2{\%} were determined in herding breed mixes and unclassified mixed breeds, respectively. Because of its widespread breed distribution and occurrence in many mixed breed dogs, it is difficult for veterinarians and dog owners to recognise whether MDR1-related drug sensitivity is relevant for an individual animal. This study provides a comprehensive overview of all affected dog breeds and many dog breeds that are probably unaffected on the basis of {\$}15,000 worldwide MDR1 genotyping data.},

The genetic substrates of selective breeding, however, remain largely unknown. Here, we describe a genome-wide scan for selection in 275 dogs from 10 phenotypically diverse breeds that were genotyped for over 21,000 autosomal SNPs. We identified 155 genomic regions that possess strong signatures of recent selection and contain candidate genes for phenotypes that vary most conspicuously among breeds, including size, coat color and texture, behavior, skeletal morphology, and physiology. In addition, we demonstrate a significant association between HAS2 and skin wrinkling in the Shar-Pei, and provide evidence that regulatory evolution has played a prominent role in the phenotypic diversification of modern dog breeds. Our results provide a first-generation map of selection in the dog, illustrate how such maps can rapidly inform the genetic basis of canine phenotypic variation, and provide a framework for delineating the mechanistic basis of how artificial selection promotes rapid and pronounced phenotypic evolution.},

Trisomic and monosomic (aneuploid) embryos account for at least 10{\%} of human pregnancies and, for women nearing the end of their reproductive lifespan, the incidence may exceed 50{\%}. The errors that lead to aneuploidy almost always occur in the oocyte but, despite intensive investigation, the underlying molecular basis has remained elusive. Recent studies of humans and model organisms have shed new light on the complexity of meiotic defects, providing evidence that the age-related increase in errors in the human female is not attributable to a single factor but to an interplay between unique features of oogenesis and a host of endogenous and exogenous factors.},

abstract = {The joint inference of selection and past demography remain a costly and demanding task. We used next generation sequencing of two pools of 48 Norway spruce mother trees, one corresponding to the Fennoscandian domain, and the other to the Alpine domain, to assess nucleotide polymorphism at 88 nuclear genes. These genes are candidate genes for phenological traits, and most belong to the photoperiod pathway. Estimates of population genetic summary statistics from the pooled data are similar to previous estimates, suggesting that pooled sequencing is reliable. The nonsynonymous SNPs tended to have both lower frequency differences and lower FST values between the two domains than silent ones. These results suggest the presence of purifying selection. The divergence between the two domains based on synonymous changes was around 5 million yr, a time similar to a recent phylogenetic estimate of 6 million yr, but much larger than earlier estimates based on isozymes. Two approaches, one of them novel and that considers both FST and difference in allele frequencies between the two domains, were used to identify SNPs potentially under diversifying selection. SNPs from around 20 genes were detected, including genes previously identified as main target for selection, such as PaPRR3 and PaGI.},

abstract = {Hip dysplasia (malformation of the coxofemoral joint) in dogs is a major health problem for which the British Veterinary Association (BVA) had set up a control scheme in 1965. Based on scoring nine components of the radiographs of both the left and right joints, the degree of hip joint malformation is now quantified by an overall hip score (a measure of the condition of the hip joint). The hip scores of 1258 flat-coated retrievers and 1566 Newfoundlands (registered with The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom) were analysed after merging with Kennel Club pedigree data for 19 036 flat-coated retrievers registered by 1995 and 14 336 Newfoundlands registered by 1997. The merged data included the animal's identity, date of birth, sex and hip scores and also similar records for the dog's relatives including the hip score if the relative had been tested. In recent years, breeding has been increasingly from tested parents. There has been some reduction in offspring hip scores - presumably because breeders avoided breeding from males with very high scores. However, a much greater reduction in offspring hip score would be achieved by stricter science-based selection of potential sires and dams. Regression modelling quantified the positive relationship between offspring and parental hip scores. The genetic heritability of hip scores was large and significant in both breeds (particularly from dams). The breeders in UK tended to use healthy sires for breeding but they have taken less care in selecting dams. Our regression models emphasise the need for both sires and dams, particularly dams, to be healthy with very small hip scores. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The lack of consistency between the various protocols for sample handling and the techniques used for ccfDNA analysis is one of the major obstacles in translating ccfDNA analysis to clinical practice. Although this point is highlighted regularly in the published reviews on ccfDNA analysis, no standard operating procedure currently exists despite several ongoing clinical studies on ccfDNA analysis.This review examines the preanalytical parameters potentially affecting ccfDNA concentration and fragmentation at each preanalytical step from blood drawing to the storage of ccfDNA extracts.Analysis of data in the literature and our own observations revealed the influence of preanalytical factors on ccfDNA analysis. Based on these data, we determined the optimal preanalytical protocols for ccfDNA analysis and ultimately, a guideline for the translation of ccfDNA analysis in routine clinical practice. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Public Library of Science. All rights reserved. Gir is one of the main cattle breeds raised in tropical South American countries. Strong artificial selection through its domestication resulted in increased genetic differentiation among the countries in recent years. Over the years, genomic studies in Gir have become more common. However, studies of population structure and signatures of selection in divergent Gir populations are scarce and need more attention to better understand genetic differentiation, gene flow, and genetic distance. Genotypes of 173 animals selected for growth traits and 273 animals selected for milk production were used in this study. Clear genetic differentiation between beef and dairy populations was observed. Different criteria led to genetic divergence and genetic differences in allele frequencies between the two populations. Gene segregation in each population was forced by artificial selection, promoting isolation, and increasing genetic variation between them. Results showed evidence of selective forces in different regions of the genome. A total of 282 genes were detected under selection in the test population based on the fixation index (Fst), integrated haplotype score (iHS), and cross-population extend haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH) approaches. The QTL mapping identified 35 genes associated with reproduction, milk composition, growth, meat and carcass, health, or body conformation traits. The investigation of genes and pathways showed that quantitative traits associated to fertility, milk production, beef quality, and growth were involved in the process of differentiation of these populations. These results would support further investigations of population structure and differentiation in the Gir breed.},

Also in breast cancer, the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women, this heterogeneity complicates the understanding of the stepwise sequence of pathogenic events and the design of effective and long-lasting target therapies. To disentangle this complexity and pinpoint which molecular perturbations are crucial to hijack the cellular machinery and lead to tumorigenesis and drug resistance, functional studies are needed in model systems that faithfully and comprehensively recapitulate all the salient aspects of their cognate human counterparts. Mouse models of breast cancer have been instrumental for the study of tumor initiation and drug response but also involve cost and time limitations that represent serious bottlenecks in translational research. To keep pace with the overwhelming amount of hypotheses that warrant in vivo testing, continuous refinement of current breast cancer models and implementation of new technologies is crucial. In this review, we summarize the current state of the art in modeling human breast cancer in mice, and we put forward our vision for future developments.},

(CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) ABSTRACT. Canine histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is a malignancy originating from the histiocytic cell lineage and characterized by poor response to chemotherapy and short survival time. Mutation of the TP53 gene and its association with poor prognosis has been reported in several canine tumors. However, the mutation of this gene has not been investigated in canine HS. The aim of this study was to examine a TP53 gene mutation in dogs with HS. Aberrations of the TP53 gene were examined by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and DNA sequence analysis, revealing mutations of the TP53 gene in 12 (46{\%}) of 26 dogs affected by HS. The incidence of the TP53 gene mutation was relatively high in canine HS compared with other canine tumors. Among these mutations, 10 of 12 dogs (83{\%}) with a TP53 gene mutation harbored the same mutation: a 2-base (AT) insertion in exon 5, resulting in the introduction of a stop codon (c.446{\_}447insAT, p.Tyr150SerfsX8). Further studies are needed to examine the functional change due to the mutation and its association with the pathogenesis of canine HS. Canine histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is a rare neoplasm originating from histiocytic cell lineages, including dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages [1, 7]. HS arises from interstitial DCs and is subdivided into two categories: localized and disseminated HS. In addition, a third subtype, hemophagocytic HS, that arises from macrophages, was recently described [7]. HS is characterized by aggressive biological behavior and dogs with HS have poor prognosis. Although there have been several reports describing its response to doxorubicin [14], liposomal doxorubicin [14] and paclitaxel [10], treatment with lomustine (CCNU) is selected in most cases based on the reported response rates [11-13]; however, HS often acquires chemotherapy resistance within a short time, which leads to a median survival time of less than 100 days in these study. Therefore, further study is needed to understand the pathogenesis to develop more effective therapeutic strategy for canine HS. p53, encoded by a tumor suppressor gene, TP53 [6], functions as a transcription factor that regulates gene expression that promotes apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. Mutation of the TP53 gene is known to result in tumorigenesis and drug resistance [8, 16]. In humans, TP53 is the most frequently altered gene in tumor cells and more than 50{\%} of all patients with tumors carry TP53 gene mutations [9]. As is the case with human tumors, mutations of the TP53 gene have been reported in several canine tumors, including osteosarcoma [4], lymphoma [5], mammary tumors [15] and brain tumors [17], and the proportions of patients with TP53 mutation in each tumor were 40.7, 16, 15 and 3.4{\%}, respectively. Recently, we reported that three of four canine HS cell lines had aberrations of the TP53 gene, and it was suggested that the TP53 gene might be frequently mutated in canine HS [2]. However, there have been no reports of TP53 gene mutations in primary canine HS tissues. The objectives of this study were to examine a TP53 gene mutation in canine HS for the elucidation of its pathogenesis.},

The elucidation of these signatures of selection is of interest from the perspective of evolutionary biology and for identifying selected genes that ultimately may help to further genetically improve these economically important species. Genome-wide screenings based on population techniques provide analytical tools to detect these signatures in relation to the act of selection. This review outlines a nonmathematical treatment of the theories and approaches available to scan the genome for evidence of positive selection and is intended for readers who are little or not familiar with population genetics theory. We discuss the genetics underlying phenotypic variation and adaptation and highlight molecular pattern that positive selection leaves behind along with the statistical approaches that are developed to detect such signatures. We describe some of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different strategies and also the challenges with identifying signatures of selection. Ascertainment bias with widely used SNP arrays is also a topic of interest. Finally we review approaches to assess the statistical significance of a signal at a particular locus or window and discuss factors affecting the statistical power to detect selective sweeps. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

HDR is critical for the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other lesions, and HDR factors also protect stalled replication forks. As a result, loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 poses significant risks to genome integrity, leading not only to cancer predisposition but also to sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, affecting therapeutic approaches. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2, including how they genetically interact with other repair factors, how they protect stalled replication forks, how they affect the response to aldehydes, and how loss of their functions links to mutation signatures. Importantly, given the recent advances with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) for the treatment of HDR-deficient tumors, we discuss mechanisms by which BRCA-deficient tumors acquire resistance to PARPi and other agents.},

abstract = {Objective: To establish a predictive method using whole genome genotyping for early intervention in canine hip dysplasia (CHD) risk management, for the prevention of the progression of secondary osteoarthritis (OA), and for selective breeding. Design: Two sets of dogs (six breeds) were genotyped with dense SNPs covering the entire canine genome. The first set contained 359 dogs upon which a predictive formula for genomic breeding value (GBV) was derived by using their estimated breeding value (EBV) of the Norberg angle (a measure of CHD) and their genotypes. To investigate how well the formula would work for an individual dog with genotype only (without using EBV), a cross validation was performed by masking the EBV of one dog at a time. The genomic data and the EBV of the remaining dogs were used to predict the GBV for the single dog that was left out. The second set of dogs included 38 new Labrador retriever dogs, which had no pedigree relationship to the dogs in the first set. Results: The cross validation showed a strong correlation (R{\textgreater} 0.7) between the EBV and the GBV. The independent validation showed a moderate correlation (R= 0.5) between GBV for the Norberg angle and the observed Norberg angle (no EBV was available for the new 38 dogs). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the genomic data were all above 70{\%}. Conclusions: Prediction of CHD from genomic data is feasible, and can be applied for risk management of CHD and early selection for genetic improvement to reduce the prevalence of CHD in breeding programs. The prediction can be implemented before maturity, at which age current radiographic screening programs are traditionally applied, and as soon as DNA is available. {\textcopyright} 2010 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.},

abstract = {Flat-Coated Retrievers seem to be at increased risk of developing soft-tissue sarcomas, and undifferentiated round cell or spindle cell sarcomas account for approximately 59{\%} of sarcomas in the breed. In an attempt to classify these tumors further, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from 14 undifferentiated sarcomas from Flat-Coated Retrievers were reviewed and examined with a panel of histologic and immunohistochemical stains. The panel included vimentin, desmin, Myo D1, smooth muscle actin, cytokeratin, S100, von Willebrand factor (factor VIII), Mac 387, CD3, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, and CD79a. The majority of the sarcomas showed greater than 70{\%} staining for MHC class II. We conclude that these undifferentiated sarcomas in Flat-Coated Retrievers belong to a spectrum of tumors with varying proportions of characteristic cell types and morphologic features, some of which fit the diagnostic criteria for malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Many of these sarcomas seem to have a significant myofibroblast component and a mild or moderate T cell infiltrate but the precise cell lineage is still uncertain.},

To date, at least 12 purebred dog breeds have been found to be affected by this mutation. The aim of this study was to update information about the prevalence of ABCB1 mutation (c.227{\_}230delATAG) in predisposed breeds in multiple European countries. This large scale survey also includes countries which were not involved in previous studies. The samples were collected in the period from 2012 to 2014. The overview is based on genotyping data of 4729 individuals. The observed mutant allele frequencies were 58.5{\%} (Smooth Collie), 48.3{\%} (Rough Col-lie), 35{\%} (Australian Shepherd), 30.3{\%} (Shetland Sheepdog), 28.1{\%} (Silken Windhound), 26.1{\%} (Miniature Australian Shepherd), 24.3{\%} (Longhaired Whippet), 16.2{\%} (White Swiss Shepherd) and 0{\%} (Border Collie). The possible presence of an ABCB1 mutant allele in Akita-Inu breed has been investigated with negative results. This information could be helpful for breeders in optimization of their breeding strategy and for veterinarians when prescribing drug therapy for dogs of predisposed breeds.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To establish a predictive method using whole genome genotyping for early intervention in canine hip dysplasia (CHD) risk management, for the prevention of the progression of secondary osteoarthritis (OA), and for selective breeding. 

DESIGN
Two sets of dogs (six breeds) were genotyped with dense SNPs covering the entire canine genome. The first set contained 359 dogs upon which a predictive formula for genomic breeding value (GBV) was derived by using their estimated breeding value (EBV) of the Norberg angle (a measure of CHD) and their genotypes. To investigate how well the formula would work for an individual dog with genotype only (without using EBV), a cross validation was performed by masking the EBV of one dog at a time. The genomic data and the EBV of the remaining dogs were used to predict the GBV for the single dog that was left out. The second set of dogs included 38 new Labrador retriever dogs, which had no pedigree relationship to the dogs in the first set. 

RESULTS
The cross validation showed a strong correlation (R{\textgreater}0.7) between the EBV and the GBV. The independent validation showed a moderate correlation (R=0.5) between GBV for the Norberg angle and the observed Norberg angle (no EBV was available for the new 38 dogs). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the genomic data were all above 70{\%}. 

CONCLUSIONS
Prediction of CHD from genomic data is feasible, and can be applied for risk management of CHD and early selection for genetic improvement to reduce the prevalence of CHD in breeding programs. The prediction can be implemented before maturity, at which age current radiographic screening programs are traditionally applied, and as soon as DNA is available.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer affecting men, it accounts for 29{\%} of all male cancer and 11{\%} of all male cancer related death. DNA is normally released from an apoptotic source which generates small fragments of cell-free DNA, whereas cancer patients have cell-free circulating DNA that originated from necrosis, autophagy, or mitotic catastrophe, which produce large fragments. 

AIM OF WORK
Differentiate the cell free DNA levels (cfDNA) and its integrity in prostate cancer patients and control group composed of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and healthy persons. 

METHODOLOGY
cf-DNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR amplification in prostate cancer patients (n = 50), (BPH) benign prostate hyperplasia (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 30) using two sets of ALU gene (product size of 115bp and 247-bp) and its integrity was calculated as a ratio of qPCR results of 247bp ALU over 115bp ALU. 

RESULTS
Highly significant levels of cf-DNA and its integrity in PC patients compared to BPH. Twenty-eight (56{\%}) patients with prostate cancer had bone metastasis. ALU115 qpcr is superior to the other markers in discriminating metastatic patients with a sensitivity of 96.4{\%} and a specificity of 86.4{\%} and (AUC=0.981) 

CONCLUSION
ALU115 qpcr could be used as a valuable biomarker helping in identifying high risk patients, indicating early spread of tumor cells as a potential seed for future metastases.},

abstract = {The 156 breeds of registered dogs in the United States offer a unique opportunity to map genes important in disease susceptibility, morphology, and behavior. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is of current interest for its application in whole genome association mapping, since the extent of LD determines the feasibility of such studies. We have measured LD at five genomic intervals, each 5 Mb in length and composed of five clusters of sequence variants spaced 800 kb-1.6 Mb apart. These intervals are located on canine chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 34, and 37, and none is under obvious selective pressure. Approximately 20 unrelated dogs were assayed from each of five breeds: Akita, Bernese Mountain Dog, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, and Pekingese. At each genomic interval, SNPs and indels were discovered and typed by resequencing. Strikingly, LD in canines is much more extensive than in humans: D′ falls to 0.5 at 400-700 kb in Golden Retriever and Labrador Retriever, 2.4 Mb in Akita, and 3-3.2 Mb in Bernese Mountain Dog and Pekingese. LD in dog breeds is up to 100x more extensive than in humans, suggesting that a correspondingly smaller number of markers will be required for association mapping studies in dogs compared to humans. We also report low haplotype diversity within regions of high LD, with 80{\%} of chromosomes in a breed carrying two to four haplotypes, as well as a high degree of haplotype sharing among breeds. {\textcopyright} 2004 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Mitotic index (MI) is an indirect measure of cell proliferation that has been demonstrated to be a strong predictor of outcome for several human and canine cancers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of MI as a predictor of biologic behavior and survival in dogs with cutaneous mast cell tumors (MCTs). Medical records from 148 dogs with histologically confirmed MCTs were reviewed. Information regarding tumor grade, local recurrence, metastatic disease, date of death/last follow-up, and outcome was obtained. The region of the tumor with the highest overall mitotic activity was chosen for evaluation, and the MI value was defined as the number of mitotic figures/10 high-power fields (4003, 2.7 mm 2). A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to compare MI with survival data. A Mann-Whitney test was used to compare MI on the basis of the development of local recurrence and metastatic disease. The MI correlated directly with tumor grade (P , .0001). The median survival time for dogs with an MI {\#}5 was significantly longer (70 months) than for those with an MI .5 (2 months), regardless of grade (P , .001). For grade II tumors with an MI {\#}5, the median survival time (MST) was 70 months, compared with 5 months for those with an MI .5 (P , .001). For grade III tumors with an MI {\#}5, the MST was not reached, compared with ,2 months for those with an MI .5 (P , .001). In conclusion, MI is a strong predictor of overall survival for dogs with cutaneous MCTs and should be included as a prognostic indicator when determining therapeutic options.},

abstract = {To ensure both long-term persistence and evolutionary potential, the required number of individuals in a population often greatly exceeds the targets proposed by conservation management. We critically review minimum population size requirements for species based on empirical and theoretical estimates made over the past few decades. This literature collectively shows that thousands (not hundreds) of individuals are required for a population to have an acceptable probability of riding-out environmental fluctuation and catastrophic events, and ensuring the continuation of evolutionary processes. The evidence is clear, yet conservation policy does not appear to reflect these findings, with pragmatic concerns on feasibility over-riding biological risk assessment. As such, we argue that conservation biology faces a dilemma akin to those working on the physical basis of climate change, where scientific recommendations on carbon emission reductions are compromised by policy makers. There is no obvious resolution other than a more explicit acceptance of the trade-offs implied when population viability requirements are ignored. We recommend that conservation planners include demographic and genetic thresholds in their assessments, and recognise implicit triage where these are not met. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Hip dysplasia (malformation of the coxofemoral joint) in dogs is a major health problem for which the British Veterinary Association (BVA) had set up a control scheme in 1965. Based on scoring nine components of the radiographs of both the left and right joints, the degree of hip joint malformation is now quantified by an overall hip score (a measure of the condition of the hip joint). The hip scores of 1258 flat-coated retrievers and 1566 Newfoundlands (registered with The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom) were analysed after merging with Kennel Club pedigree data for 19036 flat-coated retrievers registered by 1995 and 14336 Newfoundlands registered by 1997. The merged data included the animal's identity, date of birth, sex and hip scores and also similar records for the dog's relatives including the hip score if the relative had been tested. In recent years, breeding has been increasingly from tested parents. There has been some reduction in offspring hip scores — presumably because breeders avoided breeding from males with very high scores. However, a much greater reduction in offspring hip score would be achieved by stricter science-based selection of potential sires and dams. Regression modelling quantified the positive relationship between offspring and parental hip scores. The genetic heritability of hip scores was large and significant in both breeds (particularly from dams). The breeders in UK tended to use healthy sires for breeding but they have taken less care in selecting dams. Our regression models emphasise the need for both sires and dams, particularly dams, to be healthy with very small hip scores.},

abstract = {Objectives: Circulating plasma DNA is being increasingly used for biomedical and clinical research as a substrate for genetic testing. However, cell lysis can occur hours after venipuncture when using standard tubes for blood collection, leading to an increase in contaminating cellular DNA that may hinder analysis of circulating plasma DNA. Cell stabilization agents can prevent cellular lysis for several days, reducing the need for immediate plasma preparation after venipuncture, thereby facilitating the ease of blood collection and sample preparation for clinical research. However, the majority of cell stabilizing reagents have not been formally tested for their ability to preserve circulating plasma tumor DNA. Design {\&} methods: In this study, we compared the properties of two cell stabilizing reagents, the cell-free DNA BCT tube and the PAXgene tube, by collecting blood samples from metastatic breast cancer patients and measuring genome equivalents of plasma DNA by droplet digital PCR. We compared wild type PIK3CA genome equivalents and also assayed for two PIK3CA hotspot mutations, E545K and H1047R. Results: Our results demonstrate that blood stored for 7. days in BCT tubes did not show evidence of cell lysis, whereas PAXgene tubes showed an order of magnitude increase in genome equivalents, indicative of considerable cellular lysis. Conclusions: We conclude that BCT tubes can prevent lysis and cellular release of genomic DNA of blood samples from cancer patients when stored at room temperature, and could therefore be of benefit for blood specimen collections in clinical trials.},

@article{Kennedy2016,
abstract = {Canine histiocytic malignancies (HM) are aggressive tumors that occur with particularly high frequency in certain breeds including Bernese mountain dogs and flat-coated retrievers. Robust diagnosis of HM commonly utilizes immunohistochemical stains that are broadly ineffective on formalin-fixed tissues; thus the diagnosis is often one of exclusion. Clinical outcomes are generally poor, with frequent metastasis and therapeutic failure lowering overall survival at time of diagnosis to an average of less than two months in the majority of published work. The limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HM has hindered the development of more effective diagnostic modalities and the identification of therapeutic targets. A potential avenue exists for advancing clinical management of canine cancers through extrapolation from a close counterpart in human medicine. Historically, HM have been compared to the rare and understudied subset of human cancers involving the dendritic lineage, such as dendritic cell sarcoma or Langerhans cell sarcoma. Recent data have now thrown into question the cellular origin of HM, suggesting that the disease may originate from the macrophage lineage. This review summarizes existing knowledge of HM from the clinical, histologic and molecular perspectives, and highlights avenues for future research that may aid the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In turn, a more advanced appreciation of the mechanisms underlying HM should clarify their cellular origin and identify appropriate opportunities for synergistic extrapolation between related canine and human cancers.},

abstract = {Domestic dogs exhibit tremendous phenotypic diversity, including a greater variation in body size than any other terrestrial mammal. Here, we generate a high density map of canine genetic variation by genotyping 915 dogs from 80 domestic dog breeds, 83 wild canids, and 10 outbred African shelter dogs across 60,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Coupling this genomic resource with external measurements from breed standards and individuals as well as skeletal measurements from museum specimens, we identify 51 regions of the dog genome associated with phenotypic variation among breeds in 57 traits. The complex traits include average breed body size and external body dimensions and cranial, dental, and long bone shape and size with and without allometric scaling. In contrast to the results from association mapping of quantitative traits in humans and domesticated plants, we find that across dog breeds, a small number of quantitative trait loci ({\textless} or = 3) explain the majority of phenotypic variation for most of the traits we studied. In addition, many genomic regions show signatures of recent selection, with most of the highly differentiated regions being associated with breed-defining traits such as body size, coat characteristics, and ear floppiness. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of mapping multiple traits in the domestic dog using a database of genotyped individuals and highlight the important role human-directed selection has played in altering the genetic architecture of key traits in this important species.},

abstract = {The traditional way of identifying targets of adaptive evolution has been to study a few loci that one hypothesizes a priori to have been under selection. This approach is complicated because of the confounding effects that population demographic history and selection have on patterns of DNA sequence variation. In principle, multilocus analyses can facilitate robust inferences of selection at individual loci. The deluge of large-scale catalogs of genetic variation has stimulated many genome-wide scans for positive selection in several species. Here, we review some of the salient observations of these studies, identify important challenges ahead, consider the limitations of genome-wide scans for selection and discuss the potential significance of a comprehensive understanding of genomic patterns of selection for disease-related research. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Canine histiocytic proliferative disorders include a wide spectrum of diseases characterized by different biologic behaviors. The etiology and pathogenesis of these diseases are largely unknown. The clinicopathologic, morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of canine localized and disseminated histiocytic sarcoma were examined in 39 dogs. Rottweilers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, and retrievers were most commonly affected (79{\%}). Localized histiocytic sarcomas (19 dogs) arose from a single site, and metastatic lesions were observed in draining lymph nodes. Predilection sites were subcutis and underlying tissues on extremities, but tumors occurred in other locations, including spleen, lung, brain, nasal cavity, and bone marrow. Disseminated histiocytic sarcomas (20 dogs), a multisystem disease previously described as malignant histiocytosis, primarily affected spleen, lungs, bone marrow, liver, and lymph nodes. Both localized and disseminated canine histiocytic sarcomas were composed of pleomorphic tumor cell populations. CD1+, CD4-, CD11c+, CD11d-, MHC II+, ICAM-1 +, Thy-1 +/- tumor cells were identified in all snap-frozen samples (31 dogs). This phenotype is characteristic for myeloid dendritic antigen-presenting cell lineage. Hence, canine localized and disseminated histiocytic sarcomas are likely myeloid dendritic cell sarcomas. Dendritic antigen-presenting cells are a heterogeneous cell population with regards to their ontogeny, phenotype, function, and localization. The exact sublineage of the proliferating dendritic antigen-presenting cells involved in canine histiocytic sarcomas remains to be determined. Phenotypic analysis of formalin-fixed tissues from eight dogs was limited by available markers. Morphologic features and the phenotype CD18+, CD3-, and CD79a- were the most useful criteria to indicate likely histiocytic origin.},

Due to the rarity of histiocytic/dendritic cell sarcoma in humans, it is difficult to accrue such knowledge. Therefore, comparative research of these cancers in predisposed dog breeds, such as the Flatcoated retriever, can be of value. Histiocytic sarcoma in the dog can be grouped into a soft tissue- and visceral form. The soft tissue form at first is localized, while the visceral form progresses more quickly to a terminal state, which might be related to variations in gene expression. Microarray analyses were performed on fresh-frozen tissue from Flatcoated retrievers with either soft tissue- or visceral histiocytic sarcoma. Expression differences of ten most significantly differentially expressed genes were validated with quantitative real-time PCR (q PCR) analyses. Q PCR analyses confirmed the significantly aberrant expression of three of the selected genes: C6 was up-regulated; CLEC12A and CCL5 were down-regulated in the visceral histiocytic sarcoma compared to the soft tissue form. The findings of our study indicate that these two forms of histiocytic sarcoma in the dog display a variation in gene expression and warrant analysis of functional changes in the expression of those genes in these rare sarcomas in man.},

abstract = {The aims of this study were to assess genetic variances, trends and mode of inheritance for hip and elbow dysplasia in Finnish dog populations. The influence of time-dependent fixed effects in the model when estimating the genetic trends was also studied. Official hip and elbow dysplasia screening records of 42 421 dogs from seven breeds were analysed with REML. To investigate the mode of inheritance of hip and elbow dysplasia, trait distributions, genetic variances and regressions of offspring phenotypes on parental predicted breeding values were studied separately in males and in females. Genetic trends for hip dysplasia between the years 1983 and 1998 were favourable only in the Rottweiler. In elbow dysplasia, the trends were favourable after the year 1992 in all the four breeds studied but the overall changes were small. The reason for this seemed to be negligible selection pressure against these traits. Time-dependent fixed effects in the model had an influence on the estimated genetic trends, resulting either in a more negative or more positive genetic trend compared with the model from which the time-dependent effects were removed. Mitochondrial or sex-linked inheritance did not seem likely in the expression of hip and elbow dysplasia in the populations studied. Regression coefficients of offspring phenotypes on estimated parental breeding values were approximately equal to their expected value in a situation with equal parental contribution. Furthermore, the phenotypic frequency distributions of hip and elbow dysplasia grades were similar among males and females in each breed studied. No indication of major genes was found in the offspring frequency distributions within individual sires. According to these Finnish data, mode of inheritance for both hip and elbow dysplasia is polygenic (quantitative) with equal expression of the genes from both parents, although the estimates of heritability for hip dysplasia in the Rough Collie and for elbow dysplasia in the German Shepherd and the Golden Retriever were somewhat different in males compared with females.},

abstract = {The Flat Coated Retriever is a breed at risk of development of histiocytic sarcoma (HS), but in contrast to the disseminated form of disease recognized in the Bernese Mountain Dog, most reports of HS in Flat Coated Retrievers describe a localized lesion affecting the musculature or fascia of limbs. The purpose of this study was to review data and material received though an ongoing Flat Coated Retriever tumor survey to better define the presentation of HS in the breed and to determine the utility of subclassification of tumors arising at different sites by histology and immunohistologic phenotyping. Data on 180 dogs bearing HS-like tumors were available for review, which showed that although the majority (101 lesions, 57{\%}) were primary limb lesions, 47 dogs (26{\%}) had visceral, mainly splenic lesions with no peripheral primary tumor. A detailed histologic and immunohistologic review of 20 limb tumors and 20 splenic tumors showed that 2 distinct phenotypic subtypes could be identified: a histiocytic subtype, most prevalent in the splenic tumors, and a histiocytic-spindle-pleomorphic subtype, mainly seen in the limb tumors. Despite their variable morphology, all tumors expressed major histocompatibility complex class II and the leukocyte antigen CD18, but only those tumors in the spleen consistently expressed CD11d. The majority of tumors also contained a mild to moderate infiltrate of T lymphocytes.},

This has led to an increasing number of commercial kits optimised for the purification of circulating free (cf) DNA and RNA/miRNA from biofluids such as plasma, serum and urine. To optimise and standardise current practices we sought to evaluate the performance of spin column-based and magnetic bead-based commercial kits. The following commercial cfDNA purification kits were analysed in this study: QIAamp circulating nucleic acid kit (Qiagen, Germany); Plasma/serum cell-free circulating DNA Purification midi kit (Norgen Biotek, Canada); QIAamp minElute ccfDNA mini kit (Qiagen); Maxwell RSC ccfDNA plasma kit (Promega, USA); MagMAX cell-free DNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems, USA); and NextPrep-Mag cfDNA isolation kit (Bioo Scientific, USA). Extracted DNA from the plasma of healthy individuals, either nonspiked or spiked with DNA fragments or cfDNA, was evaluated for recovery using either a BioRad Experion or ddPCR analysis. This study represents the first to use a comprehensive size distribution of spiked-in DNA fragments to evaluate commercial cfDNA kits. The commonly used spin column-based Qiagen QIAamp circulating nucleic acid kit was found to be the most consistent performing kit across the two evaluation assays employed. The Qiagen QIAamp minElute ccfDNA mini kit represented the best performing magnetic bead-based kit and provides an alternative based on lower cost/sample with a simpler workflow than spin column-based kits.},

abstract = {Histiocytic malignancies in both humans and dogs are rare and poorly understood. While canine histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is uncommon in the general domestic dog population, there is a strikingly high incidence in a subset of breeds, suggesting heritable predisposition. Molecular cytogenetic profiling of canine HS in these breeds would serve to reveal recurrent DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) that are breed and/or tumor associated, as well as defining those shared with human HS. This process would identify evolutionarily conserved cytogenetic changes to highlight regions of particular importance to HS biology. Using genome wide array comparative genomic hybridization we assessed CNAs in 104 spontaneously occurring HS from two breeds of dog exhibiting a particularly elevated incidence of this tumor, the Bernese Mountain Dog and Flat-Coated Retriever. Recurrent CNAs were evaluated further by multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization and loss of heterozygosity analyses. Statistical analyses were performed to identify CNAs associated with tumor location and breed. Almost all recurrent CNAs identified in this study were shared between the two breeds, suggesting that they are associated more with the cancer phenotype than with breed. A subset of recurrent genomic imbalances suggested involvement of known cancer associated genes in HS pathogenesis, including deletions of the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A/B, RB1 and PTEN. A small number of aberrations were unique to each breed, implying that they may contribute to the major differences in tumor location evident in these two breeds. The most highly recurrent canine CNAs revealed in this study are evolutionarily conserved with those reported in human histiocytic proliferations, suggesting that human and dog HS share a conserved pathogenesis. The breed associated clinical features and DNA copy number aberrations exhibited by canine HS offer a valuable model for the human counterpart, providing additional evidence towards elucidation of the pathophysiological and genetic mechanisms associated with histiocytic malignancies. Extrapolation of data derived from canine histiocytic disorders to human histiocytic proliferation may help to further our understanding of the propagation and cancerization of histiocytic cells, contributing to development of new and effective therapeutic modalities for both species.},

However, clinical implementation of cfDNA-based tests has been slow. In this review, we addressed some of the pre- and post-analytical issues regarding cfDNA tests. First, we summarized the characteristics of cfDNA and reviewed the methods used to identify tumor-derived cfDNA from the pool of total cfDNA.

abstract = {Background The determination of altered expression of genes in specific tumor types and their effect upon cellular processes may create insight in tumorigenesis and help to design better treatments. The Flatcoated retriever is a dog breed with an exceptionally high incidence of histiocytic sarcomas. The breed develops two distinct entities of histiocytic neoplasia, a soft tissue form and a visceral form. Gene expression studies of these tumors have value for comparable human diseases such as histiocytic/dendritic cell sarcoma for which knowledge is difficult to accrue due to their rare occurrence. In addition, such studies may help in the search for genetic aberrations underlying the genetic predisposition in this dog breed. Methods Microarray analysis and pathway analyses were performed on fresh-frozen tissues obtained from Flatcoated retrievers with localized, soft tissue histiocytic sarcomas (STHS) and disseminated, visceral histiocytic sarcomas (VHS) and on normal canine spleens from various breeds. Expression differences of nine genes were validated with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses. Results QPCR analyses identified the significantly altered expression of nine genes; PPBP, SpiC, VCAM1, ENPEP, ITGAD (down-regulated), and GTSF1, Col3a1, CD90 and LUM (up-regulated) in the comparison of both the soft tissue and the visceral form with healthy spleen. DAVID pathway analyses revealed 24 pathways that were significantly involved in the development of HS in general, most of which were involved in the DNA repair and replication process. Conclusions This study identified altered expression of nine genes not yet implicated in histiocytic sarcoma manifestations in the dog nor in comparable human histiocytic/dendritic sarcomas. Exploration of the downside effect of canine inbreeding strategies for the study of similar sarcomas in humans might also lead to the identification of genes related to these rare malignancies in the human.},

abstract = {The chemical treatment of cancer started with the realization that DNA damaging agents such as mustard gas present notable antitumoural properties. Consequently, early drug development focused on genotoxic chemicals, some of which are still widely used in the clinic. However, the efficacy of such therapies is often limited by the side effects of these drugs on healthy cells. A refinement to this approach is to use compounds that can exploit the presence of DNA damage in cancer cells. Given that replication stress (RS) is a major source of genomic instability in cancer, targeting the RS-response kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) has emerged as a promising alternative. With ATR inhibitors now entering clinical trials, we here revisit the biology behind this strategy and discuss potential biomarkers that could be used for a better selection of patients who respond to therapy. This Opinion provides insight into the potential of targeting the replication stress response in cancer and discusses the strategy of inhibiting ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and the need for reliable biomarkers to enable patient stratification.},

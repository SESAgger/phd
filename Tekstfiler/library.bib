abstract = {In view of the varied biologic behavior and the costs of treatment for canine cutaneous mast cell tumors, development of appropriate treatment plans for individual affected dogs can be difficult, but decisions regarding treatment should be made using a systematic, evidence-based approach. This manuscript reviews the current state of diagnostics and prognostication of canine cutaneous mast cell tumors, and suggests a combined approach based on clinical and pathologic assessment for decision making regarding treatment choices. The current state of histologic grading, evaluation of proliferation indices, evaluation of mutations in the c-kit gene and KIT expression, evaluation of excision and clinical staging are examined. On the basis of the current understanding of prognostication and treatment response, algorithms for selection of local and systemic therapy are presented.},

abstract = {Abstract: We established a canine hemangiosarcoma cell line derived from malignant endothelial cells comprising a spontaneous tumor in a dog to provide a renewable source of endothelial cells for studies of angiogenesis in malignancy. Pieces of the hemangiosarcoma biopsy were engrafted subcutaneously in a bg/nu/XID mouse allowing the tumor cells to expand in vivo. A cell line, SB-HSA, was derived from the xenograft. SB-HSA cells expressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1 and 2, CD31, CD146, and $\alpha$v$\beta$3 integrin, and produced several growth factors and cytokines, including VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin (IL)-8 that are stimulatory to endothelial cell growth. These results indicated that the cells recapitulated features of mitotically activated endothelia. In vivo, SB-HSA cells stimulated robust angiogenic responses in mice and formed tumor masses composed of aberrant vascular channels in immunocompromised mice providing novel opportunities for investigating the effectiveness of antiangiogenic agents. Using this model, we determined that IL-12, a cytokine with both immunostimulatory and antiangiogenic effects, suppressed angiogenesis induced by, and tumor growth of, SB-HSA cells. The endothelial cell model we have described offers unique opportunities to pursue further investigations with IL-12, as well as other antiangiogenic approaches in cancer therapy.},

In the 40 years since their initial discovery, much has been learned about how this important cellular lineage develops and functions. We now know that NK cells are the founding members of an expanded family of lymphocyte known as innate lymphoid cells (ILC). Furthermore, we have recently discovered that NK cells can possess features of adaptive immunity such as antigen specificity and long-lived memory responses. Here we will review our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving development of NK cells from the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) to mature NK cells, and from activated effectors to long-lived memory NK cells.},

abstract = {Steroid hormones (SHs) are lipophilic molecules derived from cholesterol and synthesized in the adrenal cortex (glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and adrenal androgens), the testes (testicular androgens, oestrogen), and the ovary and placenta (oestrogens and progestagens or progestins). SHs reach their target cells via the blood, where they are bound to carrier proteins, and because of their lipophilic nature pass the cell membrane by simple diffusion. Within the target cells SHs bind to steroid hormone receptors (SHRs), the key mediators of SH action, which are complexed to chaperones, e.g. heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), that help other proteins to fold and prevent aggregation. SHRs are intracellular transcription factors that can be activated, among other possibilities, by the specific and high affinity binding of ligand to exert positive or negative effects on the expression of target genes. Binding of agonistic or antagonistic ligands leads to different allosteric changes of SHRs making them competent to exert positive or negative effects on the expression of target genes by different mechanisms. (i) After dissociation of chaperones the liganded SHR-complexes can bind to chromatin organized DNA sequences in the vicinity of target genes, termed hormone response elements (HREs). The HRE-recruited hormone-receptor-complexes are then able to initiate chromatin remodelling and to relay activating or repressing signals to the target genes transcription machinery; (ii) through protein-protein interactions with other sequence-specific transcription factors, SHRs can also regulate the activity of many genes that are switched on, for instance, during stress or an inflammatory response; (iii) the SH response can also be integrated in the intracellular signalling network via cross-talk of SHRs with signal transduction pathways that transmit extracellular signals via membrane receptors and activation of protein kinase cascades to nuclear transcription factors that activate various target genes. By all these different mechanisms SHRs modulate numerous and specific responses in a large variety of cells, whereby their particular effect depends on the physiological, cellular and genetic context.},

abstract = {Dogs enrolled in a Swedish insurance company (during 1995-2006) were studied for development of pyometra and mammary tumours (MTs), with special attention to breed and age. There were over 260,000 female dogs with over 1,000,000 dog-years at risk (DYAR) in the database, using data on bitches up to 10 years of age and 110 breeds with over 1000 DYAR. In total, 20 423 bitches were diagnosed with pyometra and 11,758 with MTs and 30,131 with either or both of the two diseases. The incidence rate (IR) for pyometra was 199 (95{\%} CI 196-202), for MTs 112 (95{\%} CI 110-114) and for either or both of the two diseases 297 (95{\%} CI 294-301) dogs per 10,000 DYAR. The mean age of diagnosis pyometra was 7.0 years (SD ± 2.2), MTs 8.0 years (SD ± 1.6). In all breeds, the overall proportion of the bitches that developed disease by 10 years of age was for pyometra 19{\%}, MTs 13{\%}, and either or both of two diseases 30{\%}. The top 10 breeds diagnosed with either or both of the two diseases were the Leonberger (73{\%}), Irish Wolfhound (69{\%}), Bernese Mountain Dog (69{\%}), Great Dane (68{\%}), Staffordshire Bull Terrier (66{\%}), Rottweiler (65{\%}), Bullterrier (62{\%}), Doberman (62{\%}), Bouvier des Flandres (60{\%}), Airdaleterrier (60{\%}). These data provide information of the combined disease incidence in a large number of different breeds. Breed variations in incidence rate suggests genetic components in disease development.

@article{Traill2010a,
abstract = {To ensure both long-term persistence and evolutionary potential, the required number of individuals in a population often greatly exceeds the targets proposed by conservation management. We critically review minimum population size requirements for species based on empirical and theoretical estimates made over the past few decades. This literature collectively shows that thousands (not hundreds) of individuals are required for a population to have an acceptable probability of riding-out environmental fluctuation and catastrophic events, and ensuring the continuation of evolutionary processes. The evidence is clear, yet conservation policy does not appear to reflect these findings, with pragmatic concerns on feasibility over-riding biological risk assessment. As such, we argue that conservation biology faces a dilemma akin to those working on the physical basis of climate change, where scientific recommendations on carbon emission reductions are compromised by policy makers. There is no obvious resolution other than a more explicit acceptance of the trade-offs implied when population viability requirements are ignored. We recommend that conservation planners include demographic and genetic thresholds in their assessments, and recognise implicit triage where these are not met. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Quignon2007b,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In canine genetics, the impact of population structure on whole genome association studies is typically addressed by sampling approximately equal numbers of cases and controls from dogs of a single breed, usually from the same country or geographic area. However one way to increase the power of genetic studies is to sample individuals of the same breed but from different geographic areas, with the expectation that independent meiotic events will have shortened the presumed ancestral haplotype around the mutation differently. Little is known, however, about genetic variation among dogs of the same breed collected from different geographic regions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this report, we address the magnitude and impact of genetic diversity among common breeds sampled in the U.S. and Europe. The breeds selected, including the Rottweiler, Bernese mountain dog, flat-coated retriever, and golden retriever, share susceptibility to a class of soft tissue cancers typified by malignant histiocytosis in the Bernese mountain dog. We genotyped 722 SNPs at four unlinked loci (between 95 and 271 per locus) on canine chromosome 1 (CFA1). We showed that each population is characterized by distinct genetic diversity that can be correlated with breed history. When the breed studied has a reduced intra-breed diversity, the combination of dogs from international locations does not increase the rate of false positives and potentially increases the power of association studies. However, over-sampling cases from one geographic location is more likely to lead to false positive results in breeds with significant genetic diversity. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide new guidelines for association studies using purebred dogs that take into account population structure.},

abstract = {Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is widespread in humans world-wide. The virus, which is linked to Burkitt's and Hodgkin lymphoma in humans, has recently been detected in pet dogs in Taiwan. The aim of this study was to determine if EBV is present in other canine populations, whether infection is associated with lymphoma in dogs, and whether infection is present in cats. Canine and feline serum samples were analysed by immunofluorescence assay. Antibodies to EBV or an EBV-like virus were detected in 38.4{\%} of UK dog sera, 64{\%} of US dog sera and 38{\%} of cat sera. Canine blood samples, tissue samples from the palatine tonsil and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy samples from canine lymphoma cases were analysed by PCR. Using EBV-specific primers, EBV was detected in one tonsil sample, whereas all other samples tested were negative. PCR using consensus herpesvirus primers identified canine herpesvirus in twelve tonsil samples and one biopsy but no gammaherpesviruses were detected. Canine blood samples from EBV antibody-positive dogs were analysed by RT-PCR to determine if transcripts associated with lytic EBV infection (BcLF1) or latency (LMP2) were present, however all samples tested were negative. In conclusion, there is serological evidence of exposure to EBV or an EBV-like virus in dogs and cats but persistent infection in the canine palatine tonsil is rare and no evidence was found of EBV in canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The effect of EBV on canine and feline cells and the possible outcome of the infection for the host require further investigation. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer is a major cause of death in domestic animals. Furthermore, many forms of pet neoplasm resemble that of their human counterparts in biologic behaviour, pathologic expression, and recognised risk factors.In April 2005, a pilot project was activated so as to establish a dog and cat tumour registry living in the Venice and Vicenza provinces (Veneto Region, north-eastern Italy), with the aim of estimating the incidence of spontaneous tumours. RESULTS: Through a telephone survey, the estimates of canine and feline populations of the catchment area turned out to be of 296,318 (CI +/- 30,201) and 214,683 (CI +/- 21,755) subjects, respectively. During the first three years, overall 2,509 canine and 494 feline cases of neoplasia were diagnosed. In dogs, the estimated annual incidence rate (IR) per 100,000 dogs for all tumours was 282 in all the catchment area, whereas in cats the IR was much lower (IR = 77). Malignant and benign tumours were equally distributed in male and female dogs, whereas cats had a 4.6-fold higher incidence of malignant tumours than benign. In both dogs and cats, purebreds had an almost 2-fold higher incidence of malignant tumours than mixed breeds. Tumour incidence increased with age in both dog and cat populations. CONCLUSION: This study has provided estimates of incidence of spontaneous neoplasm in companion animals. Further attempts will be made to increase the accuracy in the population size assessment and to ascertain the real gap with the official regional canine demographic registry. Veterinary practitioners may also benefit from the tumour registry insofar they may obtain data for specific breeds, age groups or geographical areas.},

abstract = {Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a multifunctional growth factor that can stimulate cell proliferation, production of proteases, and angiogenesis. Loss of mechanisms that regulate bFGF activity could result in tumor development. To test this idea, cells derived from an invasive bladder carcinoma (EJ) were compared with cells derived from a noninvasive bladder carcinoma (RT4) for the expression of bFGF and high and low affinity FGF receptors. bFGF was produced by the invasive EJ cells but not by the noninvasive RT4 cells, suggesting that bFGF could act in an autocrine fashion in the EJ cells to promote their invasion and growth in the surrounding tissue. The two cells lines also showed differences in FGF receptor expression. The EJ cells expressed both high and low affinity FGF receptors as determined by Scatchard analysis, whereas the RT4 cells expressed only high affinity receptors. The high affinity receptors on the RT4 cells were not recognized by an antibody to known FGF receptors. Furthermore, in contrast to the EJ cells, bFGF did not induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the RT4 cells. Thus these data suggest that the invasive potential of bladder carcinoma cells may be regulated by the expression of both bFGF and its receptors.},

abstract = {Progestin withdrawal is a crucial event for the onset of labor in many mammalian species. However, in humans the mechanism of a functional progestin withdrawal is unclear, because progestin concentrations do not drop in maternal plasma preceding labor. We report the presence of two novel functional membrane progestin receptors (mPRs), mPRalpha and mPRbeta, in human myometrium that are differentially modulated during labor and by steroids in vitro. The mPRs are coupled to inhibitory G proteins, resulting in a decline in cAMP levels and increased phosphorylation of myosin light chain, both of which facilitate myometrial contraction. Activation of mPRs leads to transactivation of PR-B, the first evidence for cross-talk between membrane and nuclear PRs. Progesterone activation of the mPRs leads also to a decrease of the steroid receptor coactivator 2. Our data indicate the presence of a novel signaling pathway mediated by mPRs that may result in a functional progestin withdrawal, shifting the balance from a quiescent state to one of contraction.},

These alterations induce genome instability and promote carcinogenesis steps and cancer progression processes. These defects in DNA repair have also been considered as suitable targets for cancer therapies. A most effective target so far clinically demonstrated is “homologous recombination repair defect” such as BRCA1/2 mutations, which were shown to cause synthetic lethality with inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which in turn is involved in DNA repair as well as multiple physiological processes. Different approaches targeting genomic instability, including immune therapy targeting mismatch-repair deficiency, have also recently been demonstrated to be promising strategies. In these DNA repair targeting-strategies, common issues could be how to optimize treatment and suppress/conquer the development of drug resistance. In this article, we review the extending framework of DNA repair response pathways and the potential impact of exploiting those defects on cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immune therapy.},

abstract = {To investigate whether inactivation of the p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) protein pathways contributes to the development of canine hemangiosarcoma (HSA), we examined immunohistochemically the expression of p53, Rb, phosphorylated Rb (phospho-Rb), p16, and cyclin D1 in 39 spontaneous canine HSAs and 10 hemangiomas. In addition, mutations in the p53 gene were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-stranded conformation polymorphism and PCR direct sequencing; furthermore, we quantified cyclin D1 mRNA by semiquantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Positive immunoreactivity for p53 was observed in 17.9{\%} of HSAs. However, mutations were not detected in these cases. The labeling indices for Rb, phospho-Rb, and cyclin D1 were markedly higher in all HSAs than in hemangiomas. Of the 7 cases with cyclin D1-positive immunoreactivity, 4 overexpressed cyclin D1 mRNA (to a level more than 10-fold higher than that of GAPDH mRNA). The p16 protein was clearly detected in all hemangiomas; however, 82{\%} of the neoplastic cells in HSA showed a loss of or low immunoreactivity. These results suggest that alteration of the p16-cyclin D1-Rb pathway, rather than the p53 pathway, may be associated with the pathogenesis of canine HSA.},

In these cases, replication-coupled repair mechanisms remove the mistake or repair the template lesions to ensure high fidelity and complete copying of the genome. Failures in these genome maintenance activities generate mutations, rearrangements, and chromosome segregation problems that cause many human diseases. In this review, I provide a broad overview of replication-coupled repair pathways, explaining how they fix polymerase mistakes, respond to template damage that acts as obstacles to the replisome, deal with broken forks, and impact human health and disease. Replication-coupled DNA repair minimizes replication errors and prevents disease. This review discusses these mechanisms and provides perspective on important concepts and outstanding questions.},

These biological actions of NO make it an important component in the endogenous defense against atherosclerosis and its overt clinical complications. Loss of the functional integrity of the endothelium, as seen commonly in the milieu of cardiovascular risk factors, plays an integral role in all stages of atherosclerosis from lesion initiation to plaque rupture. A number of established techniques can assess endothelial function in human vascular beds. The outcome of endothelial testing has profound prognostic implications and is an independent predictor of atherosclerosis disease progression and cardiovascular event rates. The large clinical benefit of statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with atherosclerosis involves favorable effects of endothelial function. Studies of endothelial function represent a prime example of a successful application of insights derived from vascular biology at the bedside.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs of 18-25 nucleotides in length that function as negative regulators. miRNAs post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by either inhibiting mRNA translation or inducing mRNA degradation, and participate in a wide variety of physiological and pathological cellular processes. Recent reports have revealed that the deregulation of miRNAs correlates with various human cancers and is involved in the initiation and progression of human cancers. miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors to inhibit the expression of cancer-related target genes and to promote or suppress tumorigenesis in various tissues. Therefore, abnormal miRNA expression can be regarded as a common feature of human cancers, and the identification of miRNAs and their respective targets may provide potential diagnostic and prognostic tumor biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies to treat cancers. In the present review, we discuss the emerging roles of miRNAs in the hallmarks of human cancers. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The traditional way of identifying targets of adaptive evolution has been to study a few loci that one hypothesizes a priori to have been under selection. This approach is complicated because of the confounding effects that population demographic history and selection have on patterns of DNA sequence variation. In principle, multilocus analyses can facilitate robust inferences of selection at individual loci. The deluge of large-scale catalogs of genetic variation has stimulated many genome-wide scans for positive selection in several species. Here, we review some of the salient observations of these studies, identify important challenges ahead, consider the limitations of genome-wide scans for selection and discuss the potential significance of a comprehensive understanding of genomic patterns of selection for disease-related research. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In one cat, C1, cell-mediated immunity was depressed throughout the monitoring period but particularly from 125–200 weeks post-infection (pi), when this cat demonstrated profoundly impaired lymphocyte blastogenesis and markedly increased interleukin-1 (IL-1) production compared to age-matched, uninfected control cats. Lymphocyte function in the other cat, C2, was preserved to a greater degree. Alterations in the levels of immunoglobulin isotypes M, A and G in CD4+-, CD8+- and CD21+-lymphocyte sub-sets were demonstrated in both cats. Southern blot analysis revealed the presence of integrated FIV-provirus in tumour DNA from C2 but not C1 indicating a possible direct role for the virus in the former case only. In this study we have characterised, for the first time, the FIV-induced immune dysfunction in cats which developed lymphoma, demonstrating potential indirect mechanisms of tumourigenesis.},

abstract = {The joint inference of selection and past demography remain a costly and demanding task. We used next generation sequencing of two pools of 48 Norway spruce mother trees, one corresponding to the Fennoscandian domain, and the other to the Alpine domain, to assess nucleotide polymorphism at 88 nuclear genes. These genes are candidate genes for phenological traits, and most belong to the photoperiod pathway. Estimates of population genetic summary statistics from the pooled data are similar to previous estimates, suggesting that pooled sequencing is reliable. The nonsynonymous SNPs tended to have both lower frequency differences and lower FST values between the two domains than silent ones. These results suggest the presence of purifying selection. The divergence between the two domains based on synonymous changes was around 5 million yr, a time similar to a recent phylogenetic estimate of 6 million yr, but much larger than earlier estimates based on isozymes. Two approaches, one of them novel and that considers both FST and difference in allele frequencies between the two domains, were used to identify SNPs potentially under diversifying selection. SNPs from around 20 genes were detected, including genes previously identified as main target for selection, such as PaPRR3 and PaGI.},

Given the recent study that in the heart, estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is involved in adaptive mechanisms by supporting cardiomyocytes survival via post-infarct cardiac c-kit+ cells, we tested a novel hypothesis that membrane ERalpha (mERsmall a, Cyrillic) supports survival of BM c-kit+ cells and enhance protective paracrine function for cardiac repair. Our data showed that myocardial infarction (MI) leads to an increase in c-kit+ first in bone marrow and then specifically within the infarcted myocardium. Also up-regulated mERsmall a, Cyrillic in post-infarct BM c-kit+ cells was found in day 3 post MI. In vitro co-culture system, mERsmall a, Cyrillic+ enhances the beneficial effects of BM c-kit+ cells by increasing their viability and reducing apoptosis. Post-infarct c-kit+ mERsmall a, Cyrillic+ cells population expresses predominant ERalpha and holds self-renewal as well as cardiac differentiation potentials after MI. In vivo, BM c-kit+ cells reduced infarct size, fibrosis and improved cardiac function. In conclusion, BM c-kit+ mERsmall a, Cyrillic+ exerted significantly cardiac protection after MI. A potential important implication of this study is that the manipulation of BM c-kit+ stem cells with ERsmall a, Cyrillic-dependent fashion may be helpful in recovering functional performance after cardiac tissue injury.},

These experiments, together with an evaluation of the inhibition of transcription and proteasome action, demonstrate that proteasome-mediated degradation and hER$\alpha$-mediated transactivation are inherently linked and act to continuously turn over hER$\alpha$ on responsive promoters.

abstract = {Dogs, with their breed-determined limited genetic background, are great models of human disease including cancer. Canine B-cell lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma are both malignancies of the hematologic system that are clinically and histologically similar to human B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and angiosarcoma, respectively. Golden retrievers in the US show significantly elevated lifetime risk for both B-cell lymphoma (6{\%}) and hemangiosarcoma (20{\%}). We conducted genome-wide association studies for hemangiosarcoma and B-cell lymphoma, identifying two shared predisposing loci. The two associated loci are located on chromosome 5, and together contribute {\~{}}20{\%} of the risk of developing these cancers. Genome-wide p-values for the top SNP of each locus are 4.6×10-7 and 2.7×10-6, respectively. Whole genome resequencing of nine cases and controls followed by genotyping and detailed analysis identified three shared and one B-cell lymphoma specific risk haplotypes within the two loci, but no coding changes were associated with the risk haplotypes. Gene expression analysis of B-cell lymphoma tumors revealed that carrying the risk haplotypes at the first locus is associated with down-regulation of several nearby genes including the proximal gene TRPC6, a transient receptor Ca2+-channel involved in T-cell activation, among other functions. The shared risk haplotype in the second locus overlaps the vesicle transport and release gene STX8. Carrying the shared risk haplotype is associated with gene expression changes of 100 genes enriched for pathways involved in immune cell activation. Thus, the predisposing germ-line mutations in B-cell lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma appear to be regulatory, and affect pathways involved in T-cell mediated immune response in the tumor. This suggests that the interaction between the immune system and malignant cells plays a common role in the tumorigenesis of these relatively different cancers.},

Although some cases are associated with immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, or viral infections, in most cases the causes of NHL are not understood. However, there have been some important advances in our understanding of the development of healthy lymphocytes and the pathogenesis of NHL over the past 10 years. These advances have been accompanied by an improvement in treatment for NHL. Before the late 1990s, the only treatment option available was cytotoxic chemotherapy. In the past 10 years, however, high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell reconstitution have become established parts of treatment for aggressive lymphoma. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies have become another therapeutic option. Rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) is the most advanced monoclonal antibody in clinical trials and has become part of standard treatment for some lymphomas. Rituximab, and many other monoclonal antibodies, continue to be assessed in clinical studies. Monoclonal antibodies can be used alone or in combination with standard-dose or high-dose chemotherapy, and they can also be conjugated to radionuclides to enhance cytotoxicity. Here, we review advances in the treatment of NHL that have occurred over the past 10 years.},

abstract = {The term "lymphoma" describes a heterogeneous group of disorders involving monoclonal proliferation of malignant lymphocytes. As a group, lymphomas are among the most common tumors of dogs. Yet our enumeration and understanding of the many subtypes of lymphoma have been relatively slow, perhaps in part because for many years lymphoma was treated as a singular entity rather than a group of distinct diseases. The recognition that the full spectrum of lymphoid malignancies seen in humans also occurs in dogs, and that these tumors retain not only morphologic similarities and biological behavior but also synonymous driver molecular abnormalities, sets an ideal stage for dual-purpose research that can accelerate progress for these diseases in both species. Specifically, dogs represent exceptional models for defining causality, understanding progression, and developing new treatments for lymphoma in comparatively brief windows of time. Unique advantages of canine models include (1) spontaneous disease occurring without an isogenic background or genetic engineering ; (2) chronology of disease adapted to lifespan, (3) shared environment and societal status that allows dogs to be treated as "patients," while at the same time being able to ethically explore translational innovations that are not possible in human subjects; and (4) organization of dogs into breeds with relatively homogeneous genetic backgrounds and distinct predisposition for lymphomas. Here, we will review recent studies describing intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of canine and human lymphomas, as well as newly developed tools that will enhance the fidelity of these models to improve diagnosis and develop new treatments. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene expression is highly up-regulated in canine hemangiosarcoma (HSA); however, its role in the pathogenesis of this disease is unknown. We investigated the expression of IL-8 in canine HSA tissues and cell lines, as well and the effects of IL-8 on canine HSA in vitro, and in vivo using a mouse xenograft model for the latter. Constitutive expression of IL-8 mRNA, IL-8 protein, and IL-8 receptor were variable among different tumor samples and cell lines, but they showed stable steady states in each cell line. Upon the addition of IL-8, HSA cells showed transient intracellular calcium fluxes, suggesting that their IL-8 receptors are functional and that IL-8 binding activates relevant signaling pathways. Yet, neither addition of exogenous IL-8 nor blockade of endogenous IL-8 by neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibody ($\alpha$-IL-8 Ab) affected HSA cell proliferation or survival in vitro. To assess potential effects of IL-8 in other tumor constituents, we stratified HSA cell lines and whole tumor samples into "IL-8 high" and "IL-8 low" groups. Genome-wide gene expression profiling showed that samples in the "IL-8 high" tumor group were enriched for genes associated with a "reactive microenvironment," including activation of coagulation, inflammation, and fibrosis networks. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the effects of IL-8 on these tumors were mostly indirect, regulating interactions with the microenvironment. This hypothesis was supported by in vivo xenograft experiments where survival and engraftment of tumor cells was inhibited by administration of neutralizing $\alpha$-IL-8 Ab. Together, our results suggest that IL-8 contributes to establishing a permissive microenvironment during the early stages of tumorigenesis in HSA. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Reproduction is a risky affair; a lifespan cost of maintaining reproductive capability, and of reproduction itself, has been demonstrated in a wide range of animal species. However, little is understood about the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Most cost-of-reproduction studies simply ask how reproduction influences age at death, but are blind to the subjects' actual causes of death. Lifespan is a composite variable of myriad causes of death and it has not been clear whether the consequences of reproduction or of reproductive capability influence all causes of death equally. To address this gap in understanding, we compared causes of death among over 40,000 sterilized and reproductively intact domestic dogs, Canis lupus familiaris. We found that sterilization was strongly associated with an increase in lifespan, and while it decreased risk of death from some causes, such as infectious disease, it actually increased risk of death from others, such as cancer. These findings suggest that to understand how reproduction affects lifespan, a shift in research focus is needed. Beyond the impact of reproduction on when individuals die, we must investigate its impact on why individuals die, and subsequently must identify the mechanisms by which these causes of death are influenced by the physiology associated with reproductive capability. Such an approach may also clarify the effects of reproduction on lifespan in people.},

abstract = {Canine osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive tumour that accounts for approximately 90{\%} of primary bone tumours in the dog. Although the standard treatments (including limb amputation/sparing, chemotherapy and palliative radiotherapy) have significantly increased survival rates, almost 90{\%} of animals will eventually develop predominantly pulmonary metastases. Despite advances in various therapies, prognosis remains poor, with median survival times ranging from 3. months to 1. year and {\textless}20{\%} of dogs survive for {\textgreater}2. years following diagnosis.Various clinical and epidemiological markers have facilitated decision-making with respect to therapy but no single molecular biomarker has been shown to enhance prediction of disease progression. The publication of the canine genome in 2005 raised the possibility of increasing understanding of the genetic mechanisms underpinning canine OS. This review explores the use of biomarkers within the multi-disciplinary management of dogs with OS, and highlights the few known, potential prognostic/predictive molecular markers including their potential value as 'bridging biomarkers' for human OS. Although high-throughput profiling of canine OS remains in its infancy, research within the next decade using leading-edge screening technologies has the potential to identify biomarkers that may enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracy and result in more effective, individually tailored, treatment and management protocols for affected dogs. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

HDR is critical for the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other lesions, and HDR factors also protect stalled replication forks. As a result, loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 poses significant risks to genome integrity, leading not only to cancer predisposition but also to sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, affecting therapeutic approaches. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2, including how they genetically interact with other repair factors, how they protect stalled replication forks, how they affect the response to aldehydes, and how loss of their functions links to mutation signatures. Importantly, given the recent advances with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) for the treatment of HDR-deficient tumors, we discuss mechanisms by which BRCA-deficient tumors acquire resistance to PARPi and other agents.},

Genetic studies have demonstrated that ovarian hormones act through NF-kappaB to stimulate proliferation and ductal elongation, whereas the p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a central role in rendering the mammary epithelium resistant to tumorigenesis. Transcriptional profiles now suggest that ovarian hormones stimulate a constellation of genes that interact with NF-kappaB and p53 to arbitrate the competing demands for proliferation and surveillance. Genes that participate in chromatin remodeling are among the acute transcriptional responses to estrogens and progestins. These genes are proposed to initiate epigenetic programs that influence the balance between proliferation and surveillance, and render the breast epithelium resistant to tumors.},

abstract = {Abstract It is now widely recognized that epigenetic events are important mechanisms underlying cancer development and progression. Epigenetic information in chromatin includes covalent modifications (such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination) of core nucleosomal proteins (histones). A recent progress in the field of histone modifications and chromatin research has tremendously enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the control of key physiological and pathological processes. Histone modifications and other epigenetic mechanisms appear to work together in establishing and maintaining gene activity states, thus regulating a wide range of cellular processes. Different histone modifications themselves act in a coordinated and orderly fashion to regulate cellular processes such as gene transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Interest in histone modifications has further grown over the last decade with the discovery and characterization of a large number of histone-modifying molecules and protein complexes. Alterations in the function of histone-modifying complexes are believed to disrupt the pattern and levels of histone marks and consequently deregulate the control of chromatin-based processes, ultimately leading to oncogenic transformation and the development of cancer. Consistent with this notion, aberrant patterns of histone modifications have been associated with a large number of human malignancies. In this chapter, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the establishment and maintenance of histone marks and how disruptions of these chromatin-based mechanisms contribute to tumorigenesis. We also suggest how these advances may facilitate the development of novel strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat human malignancies.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that estrogen withdrawal by gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRHa) induces osteocyte death via apoptosis in human bone. Although it is likely that the increase in osteocyte death via apoptosis was related to the loss of estrogen, these experiments could not rule out a direct role for the GnRHa. Therefore, in this study, we have used a rat model of ovariectomy (OVX) to determine whether the effect of estrogen withdrawal extends to other species and to clarify the role of estrogen in the maintenance of osteocyte viability. Twelve 9-week-old rats were divided into three treatment groups: sham operated (SHAM) (n = 4), OVX (n = 4), and OVX + estrogen (E2) (25 microg/day) (n = 4). At 3 weeks following the start of treatment, tibial bones were removed. The percentage of osteocytes displaying DNA breaks, using an in situ nick-translation method, was significantly higher in the OVX group compared with the SHAM control in both cortical bone (10.04{\%} vs. 2.31{\%}, respectively; p {\textless} 0.0001) and trabecular bone (6.44{\%} vs. 1.58{\%}, respectively; p = 0.003). Addition of estrogen in the OVX animals completely abrogated the increase in osteocyte apoptosis in cortical bone (0.78{\%}) and trabecular bone (1.17{\%}). The percentage of apoptotic osteocytes decreased with increasing distance from the primary/secondary spongiosa interface below the growth plate in the OVX model and the OVX + E2 model. Nuclear morphology and electrophoresis of DNA confirmed the presence of apoptotic cells in the samples. In conclusion, OVX in the rat results in an increase in osteocyte apoptosis as a direct or indirect result of E2 loss. Addition of estrogen in the OVX animals prevents this increase in osteocyte apoptosis. These data confirm an important role for estrogen in the control of osteocyte apoptosis and the maintenance of osteocyte viability. Estrogen deficiency might, through compromising the viability of osteocyte networks, reduce the ability of bone to respond appropriately to loading.},

abstract = {Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases, PI3Ks, constitute a lipid kinase family characterized by their ability to phosphorylate inositol ring 3′-OH group in inositol phospholipids to generate the second messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI-3,4,5-P3). RPTK activation results in PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 production by PI3K at the inner side of the plasma membrane. Akt interacts with these phospholipids, causing its translocation to the inner membrane, where it is phosphorylated and activated by PDK1 and PDK2. Activated Akt modulates the function of numerous substrates involved in the regulation of cell survival, cell cycle progression and cellular growth. In recent years, it has been shown that PI3K/Akt signalling pathway components are frequently altered in human cancers. Cancer treatment by chemotherapy and $\gamma$-irradiation kills target cells primarily by the induction of apoptosis. However, the development of resistance to therapy is an important clinical problem. Failure to activate the apoptotic programme represents an important mode of drug resistance in tumor cells. Survival signals induced by several receptors are mediated mainly by PI3K/Akt, hence this pathway may decisively contribute to the resistant phenotype. Many of the signalling pathways involved in cellular transformation have been elucidated and efforts are underway to develop treatment strategies that target these specific signalling molecules or their downstream effectors. The PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in many of the mechanisms targeted by these new drugs, thus a better understanding of this crossroad can help to fully exploit the potential benefits of these new agents.},

This assumption is based on the expression of hormone receptors in MCs as well as on the fact that many MC-related pathophysiological alterations have a different prevalence in females than in males. Further, serum IgE levels are much higher in allergic female mice compared to male mice. Ovariectomized rats developed less airway inflammation compared to sham controls. Following estrogen replacement ovariectomized rats re-established airway inflammation levels' found in intact females. In humans, a much higher asthma prevalence was found in women at reproductive age as compared to men. Serum levels of estradiol and progesterone have been directly correlated with the clinical and functional features of asthma. Around 30-40{\%} of women who have asthma experienced worsening of their symptoms during the perimenstrual phase, the so-called perimenstrual asthma. Postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy have an increased risk of new onset of asthma. Beside, estrus cycle dependent changes on female sex hormones are related to changes on MC number in mouse uterine tissue and estradiol and progesterone were shown to induce uterine MC maturation and degranulation. We will discuss here the currently available information concerning the role of these female sex hormones on MC behavior.},

We show here that PPARgamma is expressed at high levels in both well- and poorly-differentiated adenocarcinomas, in normal colonic mucosa and in human colon cancer cell lines. Ligand activation of this receptor in colon cancer cells causes a considerable reduction in linear and clonogenic growth, increased expression of carcinoembryonic antigen and the reversal of many gene expression events specifically associated with colon cancer. Transplantable tumors derived from human colon cancer cells show a significant reduction of growth when mice are treated with troglitazone, a PPARgamma ligand.

In this study, we tried to demonstrate the heterogeneity of EPC. METHODS AND RESULTS: We cultured total mononuclear cells from human peripheral blood to get two types of EPC sequentially from the same donors. We called them early EPC and late EPC. Early EPC with spindle shape showed peak growth at 2 to 3 weeks and died at 4 weeks, whereas late EPC with cobblestone shape appeared late at 2 to 3 weeks, showed exponential growth at 4 to 8 weeks, and lived up to 12 weeks. Late EPC was different from early EPC in the expression of VE-cadherin, Flt-1, KDR, and CD45. Late EPC produced more nitric oxide, incorporated more readily into human umbilical vein endothelial cells monolayer, and formed capillary tube better than early EPC. Early EPC secreted angiogenic cytokines (vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin 8) more so than late EPC during culture in vitro. Both types of EPC showed comparable in vivo vasculogenic capacity. CONCLUSIONS: We found two types of EPC from a source of adult peripheral blood that might have different roles in neovasculogenesis based on the identified differences.},

abstract = {Identifying loci under natural selection from genomic surveys is of great interest in different research areas. Commonly used methods to separate neutral effects from adaptive effects are based on locus-specific population differentiation coefficients to identify outliers. Here we extend such an approach to estimate directly the probability that each locus is subject to selection using a Bayesian method. We also extend it to allow the use of dominant markers like AFLPs. It has been shown that this model is robust to complex demographic scenarios for neutral genetic differentiation. Here we show that the inclusion of isolated populations that underwent a strong bottleneck can lead to a high rate of false positives. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to avoid them by carefully choosing the populations that should be included in the analysis. We analyze two previously published data sets: a human data set of codominant markers and a Littorina saxatilis data set of dominant markers. We also perform a detailed sensitivity study to compare the power of the method using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), SNP, and microsatellite markers.

abstract = {Canine histiocytic malignancies (HM) are aggressive tumors that occur with particularly high frequency in certain breeds including Bernese mountain dogs and flat-coated retrievers. Robust diagnosis of HM commonly utilizes immunohistochemical stains that are broadly ineffective on formalin-fixed tissues; thus the diagnosis is often one of exclusion. Clinical outcomes are generally poor, with frequent metastasis and therapeutic failure lowering overall survival at time of diagnosis to an average of less than two months in the majority of published work. The limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlyingHMhas hindered the development of more effective diagnostic modalities and the identification of therapeutic targets. A potential avenue exists for advancing clinical management of canine cancers through extrapolation from a close counterpart in human medicine. Historically, HM have been compared to the rare and understudied subset of human cancers involving the dendritic lineage, such as dendritic cell sarcoma or Langerhans cell sarcoma. Recent data have now thrown into question the cellular origin of HM, suggesting that the disease may originate from the macrophage lineage. This review summarizes existing knowledge of HM from the clinical, histologic and molecular perspectives, and highlights avenues for future research that may aid the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In turn, a more advanced appreciation of the mechanisms underlying HM should clarify their cellular origin and identify appropriate opportunities for synergistic extrapolation between related canine and human cancers.},

abstract = {In this review we summarize recent insights into the development of human B cells primarily by studying immunodeficiencies. Development and differentiation of B cells can be considered as a paradigm for many other developmental processes in cell biology. However, it differs from the development of many other cell types by phases of extremely rapid cell division and by defined series of somatic recombination and mutation events required to assemble and refine the B cell antigen receptors. Both somatic DNA alteration and proliferation phases take place in defined sites but in different organs. Thus, cell migration and timely arrival at defined sites are additional features of B cell development. By comparing experimental mouse models with insights gained from studying defined genetic defects leading to primary immunodeficiencies and hypogammaglobulinemia, we address important features that are characteristic for human B cells. We also summarize recent advances made by developing improved in vitro and in vivo systems allowing the development of human B cells from hematopoietic stem cells. Combined with genetic and functional studies of immunodeficiencies, these models will contribute not only to a better understanding of disease affecting the B lymphocyte compartment, but also to designing better and safer novel B cell-targeted therapies in autoimmunity and allergy.},

abstract = {The steroid hormone 17␤-estradiol (E 2) is a key regulator of growth, differentiation, and function in a wide array of target tissues, including the male and female reproductive tracts, mam-mary gland, and skeletal and cardiovascular systems. The predom-inant biological effects of E 2 are mediated through two distinct intracellular receptors, ER␣ 1 and ER␤, each encoded by unique genes (1) but possessing the hallmark modular structure of func-tional domains characteristic of the steroid/thyroid hormone super-family of nuclear receptors (introduced in the Minireview Prologue (54)). Certain functional domains of the ER␣ and ER␤ exhibit a high degree of homology, namely the DNA-and ligand-binding domains, at 97 and 60{\%}, respectively, whereas considerable diver-gence is apparent in the N terminus (18{\%} homology). Hence, ER␣ and ER␤ interact with identical DNA response elements and ex-hibit a similar binding affinity profile for an array of endogenous, synthetic, and naturally occurring estrogens when assayed in vitro (2). In vitro studies also suggest the two receptors may play redun-dant roles in estrogen signaling; however, tissue localization stud-ies have revealed distinct expression patterns for each receptor that suggest otherwise. Whereas ER␣ is the predominant subtype expressed in the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, and several addi-tional target organs, ER␤ exhibits a more limited expression pat-tern and is primarily detected in the ovary, prostate, testis, spleen, lung, hypothalamus, and thymus (3). Regional expression differ-ences of the two receptors have been identified in the brain (4). Further evidence of distinct biological functions for the ERs is revealed by the contrasting phenotypes observed in the individual lines of ER knockout mice, the ␣ERKO and ␤ERKO, which exhibit phenotypes that generally mirror the respective ER expression patterns (5). The most striking phenotypes in the female ␣ERKO mice include estrogen insensitivity (leading to hypoplasia) in the reproductive tract, hypergonadotropic hypergonadism, lack of pu-bertal mammary gland development, and excess adipose tissue, whereas in the male, testicular degeneration and epididymal dys-function are major factors (5). These phenotypes combined with severe deficits in sexual behavior result in complete infertility in both sexes of the ␣ERKO. In contrast, ␤ERKO males are fertile and to date show no obvious phenotypes; however, ␤ERKO females exhibit inefficient ovarian function and subfertility. Interestingly, compound knockout mice (␣␤ERKO) exhibit phenotypes that most heavily resemble those of the ␣ERKO, with the exception of the ovarian phenotype, characterized by progressive germ cell loss accompanied by redifferentiation of the surrounding somatic cells, suggesting a requisite role for both ER forms in this tissue (6, 7). With the cloning of the first ER cDNA 15 years ago has come an immense appreciation of the complex molecular mechanisms un-derlying the diverse physiological actions of E 2 and the multitude of synthetic ER ligands. This minireview will discuss the recent pro-gress toward our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of estrogen signaling, focusing on the following four pathways: 1) classical ligand-dependent; 2) ligand-independent; 3) DNA bind-ing-independent; and 4) cell-surface (nongenomic) signaling (Fig. 1). Insights into these cellular/molecular mechanisms and the role of each ER subtype as revealed by ER-null animal models will be incorporated. A discussion of the mechanisms of action of several relevant selective ER modulator (SERM) ligands and their activi-ties through the different ER signaling pathways will follow. Classical Mechanism of Estrogen Action: Ligand-dependent The ligand-dependent mechanism of ER action is the defining element of the Class I members of the nuclear steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily (8), of which the ER␣ and -␤ are members (Fig. 1). This model states that in the absence of hormone, the receptor is sequestered in a multiprotein inhibitory complex within the nuclei of target cells. The binding of ligand induces an activat-ing conformational change within the ER and promotes ho-modimerization and high affinity binding to specific DNA response elements (EREs), which are cis-acting enhancers located within the regulatory regions of target genes. The DNA-bound receptors con-tact the general transcription apparatus either directly or indi-rectly via cofactor proteins (9), of which several have been identi-fied, including SRC-1, GRIP1, AIB1, CBP/p300, TRAP220, PGC-1, p68 RNA helicase, and SRA (discussed in the first Minireview of this series (55)). It is generally accepted that the ER-coactivator interactions stabilize the formation of a transcription preinitiation complex and facilitate the necessary disruption of chromatin at the ERE. Depending on the cell and promoter context, the DNA-bound receptor exerts either a positive or negative effect on expression of the downstream target gene. The ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of ER␣ is medi-ated by two separate nonacidic activation domains, a constitutive activation function-1 (AF-1) located within the N terminus (A/B domain) and a hormone-dependent AF-2, located in the ligand-binding domain (10). The AF-2 functional domain includes a highly conserved amphipathic ␣-helix (H12) that is essential for ligand-dependent transcriptional activity and interaction with members of the SRC family of coactivators (9, 11). AF-1 activity is also depend-ent on recruitment of coactivators, both similar and unique from those utilized by AF-2 (9, 12). The AFs function in a synergistic manner in most ligand-activated mechanisms but may also func-tion independently in certain cell and promoter contexts (13). Whereas the activation domains of ER␣ are well characterized, it is not yet clear how the homologous regions of ER␤ contribute to the transcriptional activity of the receptor. Sequence homology and in vitro studies do indicate that ER␤ also contains an AF-2 domain within the C terminus (14 –16); however, reports that this region functions independently within ER␤ (15) imply the AF-2 domains of the two ER subtypes play different roles. The high degree of sequence divergence in the N terminus, including the lack of a functional AF-1 in the human ER␤ subtype, also suggests this region may function differently (14, 15). Furthermore, murine ER␤ contains an AF-1 region very similar to that of ER␣ in both se-quence and function (17), indicating that extrapolations of findings between species may be difficult. The ERKO mice have proven useful in confirming the ligand-de-pendent ERE-mediated mechanisms of ER signaling that were postulated from previous target gene promoter analyses and in vitro studies. Perhaps the best illustrative examples of classical E 2 -ER-ERE-mediated gene induction are those exhibited by the},

abstract = {Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare human genetic disease characterized by bone marrow failure, cancer predisposition, and genomic instability. It has been known for many years that FA patient-derived cells are exquisitely sensitive to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents such as cisplatin and mitomycin C. On this basis, it was widely assumed that failure to repair endogenous interstrand cross-links (ICLs) causes FA, although the endogenous mutagen that generates these lesions remained elusive. Recent genetic evidence now suggests that endogenous aldehydes are the driving force behind FA. Importantly, aldehydes cause a variety of DNA lesions, including ICLs and DNA protein cross-links (DPCs), re-kindling the debate about which DNA lesions cause FA. In this review, we discuss new developments in our understanding of DPC and ICL repair, and how these findings bear on the question of which DNA lesion underlies FA.},

abstract = {Estrogens exert their physiological effects on target tissues by interacting with the estrogen receptors, ERalpha and ERbeta. Estrogen replacement is one the most common and effective strategies used to prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Whereas it was thought that estrogens work exclusively by inhibiting bone resorption, our previous results show that 17beta-estradiol (E2) increases mouse bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 mRNA, suggesting that estrogens may also enhance bone formation. In this study, we used quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis to demonstrate that estrogens increase BMP-2 mRNA in mouse mesenchymal stem cells. The selective ER modulators, tamoxifen, raloxifene, and ICI-182,780 (ICI), failed to enhance BMP-2 mRNA, whereas ICI inhibited E2 stimulation of expression. To investigate if estrogens increase BMP-2 expression by transcriptional mechanisms and if the response is mediated by ERalpha and/or ERbeta, we studied the effects of estrogens on BMP-2 promoter activity in transient transfected C3H10T1/2 cells. E2 produced a dose-dependent induction of the mouse -2712 BMP-2 promoter activity in cells cotransfected with ERalpha and ERbeta. At a dose of 10 nM E2, ERalpha induced mouse BMP-2 promoter activity 9-fold, whereas a 3-fold increase was observed in cells cotransfected with ERbeta. Tamoxifen and raloxifene were weak activators of the mouse BMP-2 promoter via ERalpha, but not via ERbeta. ICI blocked the activation of BMP-2 promoter activity by E2 acting via both ERalpha and ERbeta, indicating that mouse BMP-2 promoter activation is ER dependent. In contrast to E2 and selective ER modulators, the phytoestrogen, genistein was more effective at activating the mouse BMP-2 promoter with ERbeta, compared with ERalpha. Using a deletion series of the BMP-2 promoter, we determined that AP-1 or Sp1 sites are not required for E2 activation. A mutation in a sequence at -415 to -402 (5'-GGGCCActcTGACCC-3') that resembles the classical estrogen-responsive element abolished the activation of the BMP-2 promoter in response to E2. Our studies demonstrate that E2 activation of mouse BMP-2 gene transcription requires ERalpha or ERbeta acting via a variant estrogen-responsive element binding site in the promoter, with ERalpha being the more efficacious regulator. Estrogenic compounds may enhance bone formation by increasing the transcription of the BMP-2 gene.},

Twenty-eight dogs received conventional chemotherapy, 13 receivedcyclophosphamide-based metronomic chemotherapy, and 13 received both conventionaland metronomic chemotherapy. Median survival time of dogs treated with splenectomyalone was 1.6 months. Clinical stage was the only prognostic factor significantly associatedwith survival time. When the entire follow-up period was considered, there was no significantdifference in survival time between dogs treated with surgery alone and dogs treatedwith surgery and chemotherapy. However, during the first 4 months of follow-up, afteradjusting for the effects of clinical stage, survival time was significantly prolonged amongdogs receiving any type of chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.6) and among dogs receiving bothconventional and metronomic chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.4).Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Clinical stage was strongly associated with prognosisfor dogs with splenic hemangiosarcoma. Chemotherapy was effective in prolonging survivaltime during the early portion of the follow-up period. Combinations of doxorubicin-basedconventional protocols and cyclophosphamide-based metronomic protocols appeared to bemore effective than either type of chemotherapy alone, but prolongations in survival timeresulting from current protocols were modest.},

abstract = {The cancer genomics revolution has rapidly expanded the inventory of somatic mutations characterizing human malignancies, highlighting a previously underappreciated extent of molecular variability between and within patients. Also in breast cancer, the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women, this heterogeneity complicates the understanding of the stepwise sequence of pathogenic events and the design of effective and long-lasting target therapies. To disentangle this complexity and pinpoint which molecular perturbations are crucial to hijack the cellular machinery and lead to tumorigenesis and drug resistance, functional studies are needed in model systems that faithfully and comprehensively recapitulate all the salient aspects of their cognate human counterparts. Mouse models of breast cancer have been instrumental for the study of tumor initiation and drug response but also involve cost and time limitations that represent serious bottlenecks in translational research. To keep pace with the overwhelming amount of hypotheses that warrant in vivo testing, continuous refinement of current breast cancer models and implementation of new technologies is crucial. In this review, we summarize the current state of the art in modeling human breast cancer in mice, and we put forward our vision for future developments.},

The aims of the present study were to describe complications of the disease and to investigate clinically useful indicators associated with peritonitis and/or prolonged postoperative hospitalization. Results: A retrospective study was performed using records from 356 bitches diagnosed with pyometra during the years Of the 356 bitches, 315 were surgically treated by ovariohysterectomy, 9 were medically treated and 32 were euthanized without treatment. In the surgically treated bitches, univariable associations between clinical and laboratory data, risk for prolonged hospitalization (≥ 3 days) and/or signs of peritonitis, were analyzed by Chi-square and Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression models were used to assess multivariable associations. The most common complication observed in surgically treated bitches was peritonitis (40 bitches), followed by urinary tract infection (19 bitches), wound infection (8 bitches), uveitis (6 bitches), and cardiac arrhythmia (5 bitches). Leucopenia and fever/hypothermia were associated with increased risk for peritonitis (18-fold and three-fold, respectively). Moderate to severe depression of the general condition, pale mucous membranes and leucopenia were associated with increased risk (seven-fold, three-fold, and over three-point-five-fold, respectively) for prolonged postoperative hospitalization. Conclusions: Several clinically useful indicators were identified. Leucopenia was the most important marker, associated with 18-fold increased risk for peritonitis and an over three-point-five increased risk for prolonged hospitalization. Fever/hypothermia, depression and pale mucous membranes were associated with increased risk for peritonitis and/or prolonged hospitalization. The results of the present study may be valuable for identifying peritonitis and predicting increased morbidity in surgically treated bitches with pyometra.},

abstract = {Background: Angiogenesis is a prerequisite for airway remodeling in bronchial asthma. Several growth factors may play important roles in inflammation and angiogenesis through effects on inflammatory cell infiltration or neovascularization. Objective: We sought to compare bronchial vascularity and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and angiogenin in bronchial biopsy specimens from asthmatic and healthy control subjects. Methods: Bronchial biopsy specimens were obtained from 16 asthmatic subjects and 9 normal control subjects. The number of vessel profiles and the vascular area per unit area on a histologic section were estimated by using computerized image analysis after staining for type IV collagen in vessel walls. Numbers of VEGF+, bFGF+, and angiogenin+cells were determined by means of immunoreactivity. Results: The airways of asthmatic subjects had significantly more vessels (P {\textless} .05) and greater vascular area (P {\textless} .O01) than that observed in control subjects. Asthmatic subjects exhibited higher VEGF and bFGF and angiogenin immunore-activity in the submucosa than did control subjects (P {\textless} .001, respectively). Significant correlations were detected between the vascular area and the numbers of angiogenic factor-positive cells (VEGF: rs= 0.93, P {\textless} .001; bFGF: rs= 0.83, P {\textless} .001; angiogenin: rs= 0.88, P {\textless} .001) within the asthmatic airways. Furthermore, the degree of vascularity was inversely correlated with airway caliber and airway responsiveness. Colocalization analysis revealed that the angiogenic factor-positive cells were CD34+cells, eosinophils, and macrophages. Conclusion: Our results suggest that increased vascularity of the bronchial mucosa in asthmatic subjects is closely related to the expression of angiogenic factors, which may then contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma.},

(CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) ABSTRACT. Canine histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is a malignancy originating from the histiocytic cell lineage and characterized by poor response to chemotherapy and short survival time. Mutation of the TP53 gene and its association with poor prognosis has been reported in several canine tumors. However, the mutation of this gene has not been investigated in canine HS. The aim of this study was to examine a TP53 gene mutation in dogs with HS. Aberrations of the TP53 gene were examined by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and DNA sequence analysis, revealing mutations of the TP53 gene in 12 (46{\%}) of 26 dogs affected by HS. The incidence of the TP53 gene mutation was relatively high in canine HS compared with other canine tumors. Among these mutations, 10 of 12 dogs (83{\%}) with a TP53 gene mutation harbored the same mutation: a 2-base (AT) insertion in exon 5, resulting in the introduction of a stop codon (c.446{\_}447insAT, p.Tyr150SerfsX8). Further studies are needed to examine the functional change due to the mutation and its association with the pathogenesis of canine HS. Canine histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is a rare neoplasm originating from histiocytic cell lineages, including dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages [1, 7]. HS arises from interstitial DCs and is subdivided into two categories: localized and disseminated HS. In addition, a third subtype, hemophagocytic HS, that arises from macrophages, was recently described [7]. HS is characterized by aggressive biological behavior and dogs with HS have poor prognosis. Although there have been several reports describing its response to doxorubicin [14], liposomal doxorubicin [14] and paclitaxel [10], treatment with lomustine (CCNU) is selected in most cases based on the reported response rates [11-13]; however, HS often acquires chemotherapy resistance within a short time, which leads to a median survival time of less than 100 days in these study. Therefore, further study is needed to understand the pathogenesis to develop more effective therapeutic strategy for canine HS. p53, encoded by a tumor suppressor gene, TP53 [6], functions as a transcription factor that regulates gene expression that promotes apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. Mutation of the TP53 gene is known to result in tumorigenesis and drug resistance [8, 16]. In humans, TP53 is the most frequently altered gene in tumor cells and more than 50{\%} of all patients with tumors carry TP53 gene mutations [9]. As is the case with human tumors, mutations of the TP53 gene have been reported in several canine tumors, including osteosarcoma [4], lymphoma [5], mammary tumors [15] and brain tumors [17], and the proportions of patients with TP53 mutation in each tumor were 40.7, 16, 15 and 3.4{\%}, respectively. Recently, we reported that three of four canine HS cell lines had aberrations of the TP53 gene, and it was suggested that the TP53 gene might be frequently mutated in canine HS [2]. However, there have been no reports of TP53 gene mutations in primary canine HS tissues. The objectives of this study were to examine a TP53 gene mutation in canine HS for the elucidation of its pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Canine histiocytic proliferative disorders include a wide spectrum of diseases characterized by different biologic behaviors. The etiology and pathogenesis of these diseases are largely unknown. The clinicopathologic, morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of canine localized and disseminated histiocytic sarcoma were examined in 39 dogs. Rottweilers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, and retrievers were most commonly affected (79{\%}). Localized histiocytic sarcomas (19 dogs) arose from a single site, and metastatic lesions were observed in draining lymph nodes. Predilection sites were subcutis and underlying tissues on extremities, but tumors occurred in other locations, including spleen, lung, brain, nasal cavity, and bone marrow. Disseminated histiocytic sarcomas (20 dogs), a multisystem disease previously described as malignant histiocytosis, primarily affected spleen, lungs, bone marrow, liver, and lymph nodes. Both localized and disseminated canine histiocytic sarcomas were composed of pleomorphic tumor cell populations. CD1+, CD4-, CD11c+, CD11d-, MHC II+, ICAM-1 +, Thy-1 +/- tumor cells were identified in all snap-frozen samples (31 dogs). This phenotype is characteristic for myeloid dendritic antigen-presenting cell lineage. Hence, canine localized and disseminated histiocytic sarcomas are likely myeloid dendritic cell sarcomas. Dendritic antigen-presenting cells are a heterogeneous cell population with regards to their ontogeny, phenotype, function, and localization. The exact sublineage of the proliferating dendritic antigen-presenting cells involved in canine histiocytic sarcomas remains to be determined. Phenotypic analysis of formalin-fixed tissues from eight dogs was limited by available markers. Morphologic features and the phenotype CD18+, CD3-, and CD79a- were the most useful criteria to indicate likely histiocytic origin.},

abstract = {The Flat Coated Retriever is a breed at risk of development of histiocytic sarcoma (HS), but in contrast to the disseminated form of disease recognized in the Bernese Mountain Dog, most reports of HS in Flat Coated Retrievers describe a localized lesion affecting the musculature or fascia of limbs. The purpose of this study was to review data and material received though an ongoing Flat Coated Retriever tumor survey to better define the presentation of HS in the breed and to determine the utility of subclassification of tumors arising at different sites by histology and immunohistologic phenotyping. Data on 180 dogs bearing HS-like tumors were available for review, which showed that although the majority (101 lesions, 57{\%}) were primary limb lesions, 47 dogs (26{\%}) had visceral, mainly splenic lesions with no peripheral primary tumor. A detailed histologic and immunohistologic review of 20 limb tumors and 20 splenic tumors showed that 2 distinct phenotypic subtypes could be identified: a histiocytic subtype, most prevalent in the splenic tumors, and a histiocytic-spindle-pleomorphic subtype, mainly seen in the limb tumors. Despite their variable morphology, all tumors expressed major histocompatibility complex class II and the leukocyte antigen CD18, but only those tumors in the spleen consistently expressed CD11d. The majority of tumors also contained a mild to moderate infiltrate of T lymphocytes.},

abstract = {During the last 15 years spectacular progress has been achieved in knowledge on the dog genome organization and the molecular background of hereditary diseases in this species. A majority of canine genetic diseases have their counterparts in humans and thus dogs are considered as a very important large animal model in human biomedicine. Among canine monogenic diseases with known causative gene mutations there are two large groups classified as retinal dystrophies and lysosomal storage diseases. Specific types of these diseases are usually diagnosed in a single or several breeds. A well known disorder, restricted to a single breed, is congenital stationary night blindness described in Briards. This disease is a counterpart of Leber amaurosis in children. On the other hand, one of the most common monogenic human diseases (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), has its canine counterparts in several breeds (e.g., the Golden retriever, Beagle and German short-haired pointer). For some of the canine diseases gene therapy strategy was successfully applied, e.g., for congenital stationary night blindness, rod-cone dystrophy and muccopolysaccharydoses type I, IIIB and VII. Since phenotypic variability between the breeds is exceptionally high, the dog is an interesting model to study the molecular background of congenital malformations (e.g., dwarfism and osteoporosis imperfecta). Also disorders of sexual development (DSD), especially testicular or ovotesticular DSD (78,XX; SRY-negative), which is widely distributed across dozens of breeds, are of particular interest. Studies on the genetic background of canine cancers, a major health problem in this species, are also quite advanced. On the other hand, genetic studies on canine counterparts of major human complex diseases (e.g., obesity, the metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus) are still in their infancy. {\textcopyright} 2014 Society for Biology of Reproduction {\&} the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn.},

abstract = {The joint inference of selection and past demography remain a costly and demanding task. We used next generation sequencing of two pools of 48 Norway spruce mother trees, one corresponding to the Fennoscandian domain, and the other to the Alpine domain, to assess nucleotide polymorphism at 88 nuclear genes. These genes are candidate genes for phenological traits, and most belong to the photoperiod pathway. Estimates of population genetic summary statistics from the pooled data are similar to previous estimates, suggesting that pooled sequencing is reliable. The nonsynonymous SNPs tended to have both lower frequency differences and lower FST values between the two domains than silent ones. These results suggest the presence of purifying selection. The divergence between the two domains based on synonymous changes was around 5 million yr, a time similar to a recent phylogenetic estimate of 6 million yr, but much larger than earlier estimates based on isozymes. Two approaches, one of them novel and that considers both FST and difference in allele frequencies between the two domains, were used to identify SNPs potentially under diversifying selection. SNPs from around 20 genes were detected, including genes previously identified as main target for selection, such as PaPRR3 and PaGI.},

abstract = {Cancer treatment has entered the era of precision medicine, where knowledge of a patient's genetic profile is used to facilitate early diagnosis, drug selection, prognosis, prediction of drug responsiveness, the onset of secondary resistance, and relapse. Circulating free DNA (cfDNA) has emerged as an ideal source of genetic information for cancer patients, and numerous studies have explored its validity in various clinical applications. However, clinical implementation of cfDNA-based tests has been slow. In this review, we addressed some of the pre- and post-analytical issues regarding cfDNA tests. First, we summarized the characteristics of cfDNA and reviewed the methods used to identify tumor-derived cfDNA from the pool of total cfDNA. Second, we described the procedures used to extract cfDNA, which have a great impact on representativeness and yield. Finally, we discussed our thoughts on the validation of cfDNA-based tests and the reporting of test results amid drastic limitations.},

abstract = {The chemical treatment of cancer started with the realization that DNA damaging agents such as mustard gas present notable antitumoural properties. Consequently, early drug development focused on genotoxic chemicals, some of which are still widely used in the clinic. However, the efficacy of such therapies is often limited by the side effects of these drugs on healthy cells. A refinement to this approach is to use compounds that can exploit the presence of DNA damage in cancer cells. Given that replication stress (RS) is a major source of genomic instability in cancer, targeting the RS-response kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) has emerged as a promising alternative. With ATR inhibitors now entering clinical trials, we here revisit the biology behind this strategy and discuss potential biomarkers that could be used for a better selection of patients who respond to therapy. This Opinion provides insight into the potential of targeting the replication stress response in cancer and discusses the strategy of inhibiting ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and the need for reliable biomarkers to enable patient stratification.},

abstract = {Domestic dogs exhibit tremendous phenotypic diversity, including a greater variation in body size than any other terrestrial mammal. Here, we generate a high density map of canine genetic variation by genotyping 915 dogs from 80 domestic dog breeds, 83 wild canids, and 10 outbred African shelter dogs across 60,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Coupling this genomic resource with external measurements from breed standards and individuals as well as skeletal measurements from museum specimens, we identify 51 regions of the dog genome associated with phenotypic variation among breeds in 57 traits. The complex traits include average breed body size and external body dimensions and cranial, dental, and long bone shape and size with and without allometric scaling. In contrast to the results from association mapping of quantitative traits in humans and domesticated plants, we find that across dog breeds, a small number of quantitative trait loci ({\textless} or = 3) explain the majority of phenotypic variation for most of the traits we studied. In addition, many genomic regions show signatures of recent selection, with most of the highly differentiated regions being associated with breed-defining traits such as body size, coat characteristics, and ear floppiness. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of mapping multiple traits in the domestic dog using a database of genotyped individuals and highlight the important role human-directed selection has played in altering the genetic architecture of key traits in this important species.},

abstract = {Flat-Coated Retrievers seem to be at increased risk of developing soft-tissue sarcomas, and undifferentiated round cell or spindle cell sarcomas account for approximately 59{\%} of sarcomas in the breed. In an attempt to classify these tumors further, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from 14 undifferentiated sarcomas from Flat-Coated Retrievers were reviewed and examined with a panel of histologic and immunohistochemical stains. The panel included vimentin, desmin, Myo D1, smooth muscle actin, cytokeratin, S100, von Willebrand factor (factor VIII), Mac 387, CD3, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, and CD79a. The majority of the sarcomas showed greater than 70{\%} staining for MHC class II. We conclude that these undifferentiated sarcomas in Flat-Coated Retrievers belong to a spectrum of tumors with varying proportions of characteristic cell types and morphologic features, some of which fit the diagnostic criteria for malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Many of these sarcomas seem to have a significant myofibroblast component and a mild or moderate T cell infiltrate but the precise cell lineage is still uncertain.},

HDR is critical for the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other lesions, and HDR factors also protect stalled replication forks. As a result, loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 poses significant risks to genome integrity, leading not only to cancer predisposition but also to sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, affecting therapeutic approaches. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2, including how they genetically interact with other repair factors, how they protect stalled replication forks, how they affect the response to aldehydes, and how loss of their functions links to mutation signatures. Importantly, given the recent advances with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) for the treatment of HDR-deficient tumors, we discuss mechanisms by which BRCA-deficient tumors acquire resistance to PARPi and other agents.},

Students are most likely to add an undeserving author if a faculty member is also their advisor. In addition, four techniques of neutralisation, ‘diffusion of responsibility', ‘defence of necessity', ‘advantageous comparison' and ‘euphemistic labelling', are associated with student willingness to act unethically. Participants who had received responsible conduct of research training were no less likely to commit the violation than those who had not.

This has led to an increasing number of commercial kits optimised for the purification of circulating free (cf) DNA and RNA/miRNA from biofluids such as plasma, serum and urine. To optimise and standardise current practices we sought to evaluate the performance of spin column-based and magnetic bead-based commercial kits. The following commercial cfDNA purification kits were analysed in this study: QIAamp circulating nucleic acid kit (Qiagen, Germany); Plasma/serum cell-free circulating DNA Purification midi kit (Norgen Biotek, Canada); QIAamp minElute ccfDNA mini kit (Qiagen); Maxwell RSC ccfDNA plasma kit (Promega, USA); MagMAX cell-free DNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems, USA); and NextPrep-Mag cfDNA isolation kit (Bioo Scientific, USA). Extracted DNA from the plasma of healthy individuals, either nonspiked or spiked with DNA fragments or cfDNA, was evaluated for recovery using either a BioRad Experion or ddPCR analysis. This study represents the first to use a comprehensive size distribution of spiked-in DNA fragments to evaluate commercial cfDNA kits. The commonly used spin column-based Qiagen QIAamp circulating nucleic acid kit was found to be the most consistent performing kit across the two evaluation assays employed. The Qiagen QIAamp minElute ccfDNA mini kit represented the best performing magnetic bead-based kit and provides an alternative based on lower cost/sample with a simpler workflow than spin column-based kits.},

abstract = {Precision oncology is predicated upon the ability to detect specific actionable genomic alterations and to monitor their adaptive evolution during treatment to counter resistance. Because of spatial and temporal heterogeneity and comorbidities associated with obtaining tumor tissues, especially in the case of metastatic disease, traditional methods for tumor sampling are impractical for this application. Known to be present in the blood of cancer patients for decades, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is beginning to inform on tumor genetics, tumor burden, and mechanisms of progression and drug resistance. This substrate is amenable for inexpensive noninvasive testing and thus presents a viable approach to serial sampling for screening and monitoring tumor progression. The fragmentation, low yield, and variable admixture of normal DNA present formidable technical challenges for realization of this potential. This review summarizes the history of cfDNA discovery, its biological properties, and explores emerging technologies for clinically relevant sequence-based analysis of cfDNA in cancer patients. Molecular barcoding (or Unique Molecular Identifier, UMI)-based methods currently appear to offer an optimal balance between sensitivity, flexibility, and cost and constitute a promising approach for clinically relevant assays for near real-time monitoring of treatment-induced mutational adaptations to guide evidence-based precision oncology.

abstract = {Identifying loci under natural selection from genomic surveys is of great interest in different research areas. Commonly used methods to separate neutral effects from adaptive effects are based on locus-specific population differentiation coefficients to identify outliers. Here we extend such an approach to estimate directly the probability that each locus is subject to selection using a Bayesian method. We also extend it to allow the use of dominant markers like AFLPs. It has been shown that this model is robust to complex demographic scenarios for neutral genetic differentiation. Here we show that the inclusion of isolated populations that underwent a strong bottleneck can lead to a high rate of false positives. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to avoid them by carefully choosing the populations that should be included in the analysis. We analyze two previously published data sets: a human data set of codominant markers and a Littorina saxatilis data set of dominant markers. We also perform a detailed sensitivity study to compare the power of the method using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), SNP, and microsatellite markers. The method has been implemented in a new software available at our website (http://www-leca.ujf-grenoble.fr/logiciels.htm).},

A total of 1023 submissions was obtained from 782 dogs. These included 165 non-neoplastic lesions (16 per cent), 447 benign samples (44 per cent) and 411 malignant samples (40 per cent). Soft tissue sarcomas accounted for 55 per cent of the malignant samples (26 per cent of all tumour samples and 22 per cent of all submissions) with 63 per cent of them being diagnosed as undifferentiated. Carcinomas accounted for 20 per cent of malignant samples (8 per cent of all submissions). Of the benign tumours, cutaneous histiocytoma was the most common diagnosis (48 per cent of benign tumours, 25 per cent of all tumours and 21 per cent of all submissions).},

abstract = {The cancer genomics revolution has rapidly expanded the inventory of somatic mutations characterizing human malignancies, highlighting a previously underappreciated extent of molecular variability between and within patients. Also in breast cancer, the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women, this heterogeneity complicates the understanding of the stepwise sequence of pathogenic events and the design of effective and long-lasting target therapies. To disentangle this complexity and pinpoint which molecular perturbations are crucial to hijack the cellular machinery and lead to tumorigenesis and drug resistance, functional studies are needed in model systems that faithfully and comprehensively recapitulate all the salient aspects of their cognate human counterparts. Mouse models of breast cancer have been instrumental for the study of tumor initiation and drug response but also involve cost and time limitations that represent serious bottlenecks in translational research. To keep pace with the overwhelming amount of hypotheses that warrant in vivo testing, continuous refinement of current breast cancer models and implementation of new technologies is crucial. In this review, we summarize the current state of the art in modeling human breast cancer in mice, and we put forward our vision for future developments.},

To identify the genetic underpinnings of such traits, we analyze 722 canine whole genome sequences (WGS), documenting over 91 million single nucleotide and small indels, creating a large catalog of genomic variation for a companion animal species. We undertake both selective sweep analyses and genome wide association studies (GWAS) inclusive of over 144 modern breeds, 54 wild canids and a hundred village dogs. Our results identify variants of strong impact associated with 16 phenotypes, including body weight variation which, when combined with existing data, explain greater than 90{\%} of body size variation in dogs. We thus demonstrate that GWAS and selection scans performed with WGS are powerful complementary methods for expanding the utility of companion animal systems for the study of mammalian growth and biology.},

abstract = {The 156 breeds of registered dogs in the United States offer a unique opportunity to map genes important in disease susceptibility, morphology, and behavior. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is of current interest for its application in whole genome association mapping, since the extent of LD determines the feasibility of such studies. We have measured LD at five genomic intervals, each 5 Mb in length and composed of five clusters of sequence variants spaced 800 kb-1.6 Mb apart. These intervals are located on canine chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 34, and 37, and none is under obvious selective pressure. Approximately 20 unrelated dogs were assayed from each of five breeds: Akita, Bernese Mountain Dog, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, and Pekingese. At each genomic interval, SNPs and indels were discovered and typed by resequencing. Strikingly, LD in canines is much more extensive than in humans: D′ falls to 0.5 at 400-700 kb in Golden Retriever and Labrador Retriever, 2.4 Mb in Akita, and 3-3.2 Mb in Bernese Mountain Dog and Pekingese. LD in dog breeds is up to 100x more extensive than in humans, suggesting that a correspondingly smaller number of markers will be required for association mapping studies in dogs compared to humans. We also report low haplotype diversity within regions of high LD, with 80{\%} of chromosomes in a breed carrying two to four haplotypes, as well as a high degree of haplotype sharing among breeds. {\textcopyright} 2004 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Hip dysplasia (malformation of the coxofemoral joint) in dogs is a major health problem for which the British Veterinary Association (BVA) had set up a control scheme in 1965. Based on scoring nine components of the radiographs of both the left and right joints, the degree of hip joint malformation is now quantified by an overall hip score (a measure of the condition of the hip joint). The hip scores of 1258 flat-coated retrievers and 1566 Newfoundlands (registered with The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom) were analysed after merging with Kennel Club pedigree data for 19 036 flat-coated retrievers registered by 1995 and 14 336 Newfoundlands registered by 1997. The merged data included the animal's identity, date of birth, sex and hip scores and also similar records for the dog's relatives including the hip score if the relative had been tested. In recent years, breeding has been increasingly from tested parents. There has been some reduction in offspring hip scores - presumably because breeders avoided breeding from males with very high scores. However, a much greater reduction in offspring hip score would be achieved by stricter science-based selection of potential sires and dams. Regression modelling quantified the positive relationship between offspring and parental hip scores. The genetic heritability of hip scores was large and significant in both breeds (particularly from dams). The breeders in UK tended to use healthy sires for breeding but they have taken less care in selecting dams. Our regression models emphasise the need for both sires and dams, particularly dams, to be healthy with very small hip scores. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {To ensure both long-term persistence and evolutionary potential, the required number of individuals in a population often greatly exceeds the targets proposed by conservation management. We critically review minimum population size requirements for species based on empirical and theoretical estimates made over the past few decades. This literature collectively shows that thousands (not hundreds) of individuals are required for a population to have an acceptable probability of riding-out environmental fluctuation and catastrophic events, and ensuring the continuation of evolutionary processes. The evidence is clear, yet conservation policy does not appear to reflect these findings, with pragmatic concerns on feasibility over-riding biological risk assessment. As such, we argue that conservation biology faces a dilemma akin to those working on the physical basis of climate change, where scientific recommendations on carbon emission reductions are compromised by policy makers. There is no obvious resolution other than a more explicit acceptance of the trade-offs implied when population viability requirements are ignored. We recommend that conservation planners include demographic and genetic thresholds in their assessments, and recognise implicit triage where these are not met. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Objective: To establish a predictive method using whole genome genotyping for early intervention in canine hip dysplasia (CHD) risk management, for the prevention of the progression of secondary osteoarthritis (OA), and for selective breeding. Design: Two sets of dogs (six breeds) were genotyped with dense SNPs covering the entire canine genome. The first set contained 359 dogs upon which a predictive formula for genomic breeding value (GBV) was derived by using their estimated breeding value (EBV) of the Norberg angle (a measure of CHD) and their genotypes. To investigate how well the formula would work for an individual dog with genotype only (without using EBV), a cross validation was performed by masking the EBV of one dog at a time. The genomic data and the EBV of the remaining dogs were used to predict the GBV for the single dog that was left out. The second set of dogs included 38 new Labrador retriever dogs, which had no pedigree relationship to the dogs in the first set. Results: The cross validation showed a strong correlation (R{\textgreater} 0.7) between the EBV and the GBV. The independent validation showed a moderate correlation (R= 0.5) between GBV for the Norberg angle and the observed Norberg angle (no EBV was available for the new 38 dogs). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the genomic data were all above 70{\%}. Conclusions: Prediction of CHD from genomic data is feasible, and can be applied for risk management of CHD and early selection for genetic improvement to reduce the prevalence of CHD in breeding programs. The prediction can be implemented before maturity, at which age current radiographic screening programs are traditionally applied, and as soon as DNA is available. {\textcopyright} 2010 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in human blood, most studies have focused on diagnostic and prognostic uses of these markers for solid tumors. Except for some prenatal tests and BEAMing, cfDNA analysis has not yet been translated to clinical practice and routine application appears distant. This can be attributed to overlapping factors: (i) a lack of knowledge regarding the origin and function of cfDNA, (ii) insufficient molecular characterization, and (iii) the absence of an analytical consensus. In this review, we address the latter determinant and focus specifically on quantitative analysis of cfDNA. While the literature reports limited value for a single quantitative assessment, cfDNA kinetic assessment will be an essential component to qualitative characterization. In order to establish quantitative analysis for accurate kinetic assessments, process optimization and standardization are crucial. This report elucidates the most confounding variables of each preanalytic step that must be considered for optimal analysis.},

abstract = {Aneuploidy is the leading cause of congenital defects in humans and nearly always results from errors occurring in oocytes. Here, the authors review the evidence pointing towards the mechanistic basis of meiotic defects leading to aneuploidy and discuss the potential role of environmental factors. Trisomic and monosomic (aneuploid) embryos account for at least 10{\%} of human pregnancies and, for women nearing the end of their reproductive lifespan, the incidence may exceed 50{\%}. The errors that lead to aneuploidy almost always occur in the oocyte but, despite intensive investigation, the underlying molecular basis has remained elusive. Recent studies of humans and model organisms have shed new light on the complexity of meiotic defects, providing evidence that the age-related increase in errors in the human female is not attributable to a single factor but to an interplay between unique features of oogenesis and a host of endogenous and exogenous factors.},

abstract = {Human driven selection during domestication and subsequent breed formation and breeding has left detectable signatures within the genome of livestock breeds. The elucidation of these signatures of selection is of interest from the perspective of evolutionary biology and for identifying selected genes that ultimately may help to further genetically improve these economically important species. Genome-wide screenings based on population techniques provide analytical tools to detect these signatures in relation to the act of selection. This review outlines a nonmathematical treatment of the theories and approaches available to scan the genome for evidence of positive selection and is intended for readers who are little or not familiar with population genetics theory. We discuss the genetics underlying phenotypic variation and adaptation and highlight molecular pattern that positive selection leaves behind along with the statistical approaches that are developed to detect such signatures. We describe some of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different strategies and also the challenges with identifying signatures of selection. Ascertainment bias with widely used SNP arrays is also a topic of interest. Finally we review approaches to assess the statistical significance of a signal at a particular locus or window and discuss factors affecting the statistical power to detect selective sweeps. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Hip dysplasia (malformation of the coxofemoral joint) in dogs is a major health problem for which the British Veterinary Association (BVA) had set up a control scheme in 1965. Based on scoring nine components of the radiographs of both the left and right joints, the degree of hip joint malformation is now quantified by an overall hip score (a measure of the condition of the hip joint). The hip scores of 1258 flat-coated retrievers and 1566 Newfoundlands (registered with The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom) were analysed after merging with Kennel Club pedigree data for 19036 flat-coated retrievers registered by 1995 and 14336 Newfoundlands registered by 1997. The merged data included the animal's identity, date of birth, sex and hip scores and also similar records for the dog's relatives including the hip score if the relative had been tested. In recent years, breeding has been increasingly from tested parents. There has been some reduction in offspring hip scores — presumably because breeders avoided breeding from males with very high scores. However, a much greater reduction in offspring hip score would be achieved by stricter science-based selection of potential sires and dams. Regression modelling quantified the positive relationship between offspring and parental hip scores. The genetic heritability of hip scores was large and significant in both breeds (particularly from dams). The breeders in UK tended to use healthy sires for breeding but they have taken less care in selecting dams. Our regression models emphasise the need for both sires and dams, particularly dams, to be healthy with very small hip scores.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) represents a group of malignant canine tumors to which Bernese Mountain Dogs (BMD) and Flatcoated Retrievers (FCR) are predisposed. The differential diagnosis for HS is broad, encompassing round cell tumors, sarcomas and other histiocytic diseases. The aim of this study was to establish morphological and immunohistochemical criteria for routine use on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples and cytological smears for the recognition and differentiation of canine HS and its subtypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospectively, tumor sections were reviewed from 449 BMD and 380 FCR with confirmed or suspected HS, other histiocytic conditions, or a disease of the differential diagnosis of HS. RESULTS In a large proportion of cases, 47.5{\%} for histology and for 46.3{\%} cytology, the initial diagnosis was changed after the revision process. A large variation in morphological features of HS was observed in this study, making the existence of several subtypes in dogs also very likely. Furthermore, the different percentage of morphological features between BMD and FCR indicates the different mixture of cell type origins resulting possibly from genetic or environmental differences at the onset of HS in those breeds. CONCLUSION This study stresses the value of a strictly applied and standardized scoring system for microscopic evaluation of tumor sections and smears, and the implementation of review and revision of pathological diagnoses.},

abstract = {Objective: Many biomedical journals have introduced disclosure of research contribution in journal articles as a way to limit irresponsible authorship. Over the years, journals have developed different contribution disclosure policies and procedures, but it is not known how these policies and procedures affect authorship. The aim of our study was to analyse possible causative relationships between the structure of the contribution disclosure form and the number of authors who do not meet authorship criteria in biomedicine set by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). Research design and methods: In a single-blind randomized trial, 1462 authors of 332 manuscripts submitted to a general medical journal answered one of three different contribution disclosure forms: (1) open-ended - asking the respondents to describe in their own words their contributions in the submitted work; (2) categorical - with 11 possible contribution choices and (3) instructional - guiding through the ICMJE definition and instructing how many contributions are needed to satisfy individual criteria. Main outcome measure: The number of authors not satisfying ICMJE authorship criteria. Results: The group answering the instructional form had significantly fewer authors whose reported contributions did not satisfy ICMJE criteria (18.7{\%}) than the groups answering the categorical (62.8{\%}) or open-ended (54.7{\%}) form ($\chi$ 2 2 = 210.833, p {\textless} 0.001). The group receiving instructional forms also had the fewest articles with honorary authors (32.5{\%}) compared with those who responded in a categorical (68.7{\%}) or open-ended (83.0{\%}) form ($\chi$ 2 2 = 63.378, p {\textless} 0.001). All authors who answered the open-ended form, regardless of their compliance with authorship criteria, reported significantly fewer contributions (median 3 [95{\%} confidence interval = 3-3]) than authors responding to either the categorical (4 [4-4] ; zscore = -7.1899, p {\textless} 0.001) or instructional form (4 [4-5]; z score = -13.9760, p {\textless} 0.001). Honorary authors answering the instructional form reported more contributions than those answering either the categorical or open-ended form (z score = 2.7637, p = 0.0057 and z score = 3.3773, p {\textless} 0.001, respectively). Most honorary authors (39.9{\%}) lacked only the third ICMJE criterion (final approval of the submitted manuscript). Conclusions: The structure of the contribution disclosure form significantly influenced the number of contributions reported by authors of submitted manuscripts and their compliance with the ICMJE authorship criteria. Journal editors should be aware of the cognitive aspects of survey methodology when they construct for their authors self-reports about behaviour, such as contribution disclosure forms. {\textcopyright} 2006 Librapharm Limited.},

abstract = {Domestic dogs are unique from other animal models of cancer in that they generally experience spontaneous disease. In addition, most types of cancer observed in humans are found in dogs, suggesting that canines may be an informative system for the study of cancer genetics. Domestic dogs are divided into over 175 breeds, with members of each breed sharing significant phenotypes. The breed barrier enhances the utility of the model, especially for genetic studies where small numbers of genes are hypothesized to account for the breed cancer susceptibility. These facts, combined with recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies allows for an unrivaled ability to use pet dog populations to find often subtle mutations that promote cancer susceptibility and progression in dogs as a whole. The meticulous record keeping associated with dog breeding makes the model still more powerful, as it facilitates both association analysis and family-based linkage studies. Key to the success of these studies is their cooperative nature, with owners, scientists, veterinarians and breed clubs working together to avoid the cost and unpopularity of developing captive populations. In this article we explore these principals and advocate for colony-free, genetic studies that will enhance our ability to diagnose and treat cancer in dogs and humans alike.},

abstract = {Considerable clinical and molecular variations have been known in retinal blinding diseases in man and also in dogs. Different forms of retinal diseases occur in specific breed(s) caused by mutations segregating within each isolated breeding population. While molecular studies to find genes and mutations underlying retinal diseases in dogs have benefited largely from the phenotypic and genetic uniformity within a breed, within- and across-breed variations have often played a key role in elucidating the molecular basis. The increasing knowledge of phenotypic, allelic, and genetic heterogeneities in canine retinal degeneration has shown that the overall picture is rather more complicated than initially thought. Over the past 20 years, various approaches have been developed and tested to search for genes and mutations underlying genetic traits in dogs, depending on the availability of genetic tools and sample resources. Candidate gene, linkage analysis, and genome-wide association studies have so far identified 24 mutations in 18 genes underlying retinal diseases in at least 58 dog breeds. Many of these genes have been associated with retinal diseases in humans, thus providing opportunities to study the role in pathogenesis and in normal vision. Application in therapeutic interventions such as gene therapy has proven successful initially in a naturally occurring dog model followed by trials in human patients. Other genes whose human homologs have not been associated with retinal diseases are potential candidates to explain equivalent human diseases and contribute to the understanding of their function in vision. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

It has been known for many years that FA patient-derived cells are exquisitely sensitive to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents such as cisplatin and mitomycin C. On this basis, it was widely assumed that failure to repair endogenous interstrand cross-links (ICLs) causes FA, although the endogenous mutagen that generates these lesions remained elusive. Recent genetic evidence now suggests that endogenous aldehydes are the driving force behind FA. Importantly, aldehydes cause a variety of DNA lesions, including ICLs and DNA protein cross-links (DPCs), re-kindling the debate about which DNA lesions cause FA. In this review, we discuss new developments in our understanding of DPC and ICL repair, and how these findings bear on the question of which DNA lesion underlies FA.},

abstract = {Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most difficult cancers to treat with the poorest prognosis. The key to improving survival rates in this disease is early detection and monitoring of disseminated and residual disease. However, this is hindered due to lack reliable diagnostic and predictive markers which mean that the majority of patients succumb to their condition within a few months. We present a pilot study of the detection circulating free DNA (cfDNA) combined with tumor specific mutation detection by digital PCR as a novel minimally invasive biomarker in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This was compared to the detection of CTC by the CellSearch{\textregistered} system and a novel CTC enrichment strategy based on CD45 positive cell depletion. The aim of the study was to assess tumor specific DNA detection in plasma and CTC detection as prognostic markers in PDAC. We detected KRAS mutant cfDNA in 26 {\%} of patients of all stages and this correlated strongly with Overall Survival (OS), 60 days (95 {\%} CI: 19–317) for KRAS mutation positive vs 772 days for KRAS mutation negative (95 {\%} CI: 416–1127). Although, the presence of CTC detected by the CellSearch{\textregistered} system did correlate significantly with OS, 88 days (95 {\%} CI: 27–206) CTC positive vs 393 days CTC negative (95 {\%} CI: 284–501), CTC were detected in only 20 {\%} of patients, the majority of which had metastatic disease, whereas KRAS mutant cfDNA was detected in patients with both resectable and advanced disease. Tumor specific cfDNA detection and CTC detection are promising markers for the management of patients with PDAC, although there is a need to validate these results in a larger patient cohort and optimize the detection of CTC in PDAC by applying the appropriate markers for their detection.},

Analysis of four colorectal and two breast cancers with massively parallel sequencing revealed an average of nine rearranged sequences (range, 4 to 15) per tumor. Polymerase chain reaction with primers spanning the breakpoints was able to detect mutant DNA molecules present at levels lower than 0.001{\%} and readily identified mutated circulating DNA in patient plasma samples.

abstract = {Canine histiocytic malignancies (HM) are aggressive tumors that occur with particularly high frequency in certain breeds including Bernese mountain dogs and flat-coated retrievers. Robust diagnosis of HM commonly utilizes immunohistochemical stains that are broadly ineffective on formalin-fixed tissues; thus the diagnosis is often one of exclusion. Clinical outcomes are generally poor, with frequent metastasis and therapeutic failure lowering overall survival at time of diagnosis to an average of less than two months in the majority of published work. The limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HM has hindered the development of more effective diagnostic modalities and the identification of therapeutic targets. A potential avenue exists for advancing clinical management of canine cancers through extrapolation from a close counterpart in human medicine. Historically, HM have been compared to the rare and understudied subset of human cancers involving the dendritic lineage, such as dendritic cell sarcoma or Langerhans cell sarcoma. Recent data have now thrown into question the cellular origin of HM, suggesting that the disease may originate from the macrophage lineage. This review summarizes existing knowledge of HM from the clinical, histologic and molecular perspectives, and highlights avenues for future research that may aid the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In turn, a more advanced appreciation of the mechanisms underlying HM should clarify their cellular origin and identify appropriate opportunities for synergistic extrapolation between related canine and human cancers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer affecting men, it accounts for 29{\%} of all male cancer and 11{\%} of all male cancer related death. DNA is normally released from an apoptotic source which generates small fragments of cell-free DNA, whereas cancer patients have cell-free circulating DNA that originated from necrosis, autophagy, or mitotic catastrophe, which produce large fragments. 

AIM OF WORK
Differentiate the cell free DNA levels (cfDNA) and its integrity in prostate cancer patients and control group composed of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and healthy persons. 

METHODOLOGY
cf-DNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR amplification in prostate cancer patients (n = 50), (BPH) benign prostate hyperplasia (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 30) using two sets of ALU gene (product size of 115bp and 247-bp) and its integrity was calculated as a ratio of qPCR results of 247bp ALU over 115bp ALU. 

RESULTS
Highly significant levels of cf-DNA and its integrity in PC patients compared to BPH. Twenty-eight (56{\%}) patients with prostate cancer had bone metastasis. ALU115 qpcr is superior to the other markers in discriminating metastatic patients with a sensitivity of 96.4{\%} and a specificity of 86.4{\%} and (AUC=0.981) 

CONCLUSION
ALU115 qpcr could be used as a valuable biomarker helping in identifying high risk patients, indicating early spread of tumor cells as a potential seed for future metastases.},

The deluge of large-scale catalogs of genetic variation has stimulated many genome-wide scans for positive selection in several species.

Here, we describe a genome-wide scan for selection in 275 dogs from 10 phenotypically diverse breeds that were genotyped for over 21,000 autosomal SNPs. We identified 155 genomic regions that possess strong signatures of recent selection and contain candidate genes for phenotypes that vary most conspicuously among breeds, including size, coat color and texture, behavior, skeletal morphology, and physiology. In addition, we demonstrate a significant association between HAS2 and skin wrinkling in the Shar-Pei, and provide evidence that regulatory evolution has played a prominent role in the phenotypic diversification of modern dog breeds. Our results provide a first-generation map of selection in the dog, illustrate how such maps can rapidly inform the genetic basis of canine phenotypic variation, and provide a framework for delineating the mechanistic basis of how artificial selection promotes rapid and pronounced phenotypic evolution.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To establish a predictive method using whole genome genotyping for early intervention in canine hip dysplasia (CHD) risk management, for the prevention of the progression of secondary osteoarthritis (OA), and for selective breeding. 

DESIGN
Two sets of dogs (six breeds) were genotyped with dense SNPs covering the entire canine genome. The first set contained 359 dogs upon which a predictive formula for genomic breeding value (GBV) was derived by using their estimated breeding value (EBV) of the Norberg angle (a measure of CHD) and their genotypes. To investigate how well the formula would work for an individual dog with genotype only (without using EBV), a cross validation was performed by masking the EBV of one dog at a time. The genomic data and the EBV of the remaining dogs were used to predict the GBV for the single dog that was left out. The second set of dogs included 38 new Labrador retriever dogs, which had no pedigree relationship to the dogs in the first set. 

RESULTS
The cross validation showed a strong correlation (R{\textgreater}0.7) between the EBV and the GBV. The independent validation showed a moderate correlation (R=0.5) between GBV for the Norberg angle and the observed Norberg angle (no EBV was available for the new 38 dogs). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the genomic data were all above 70{\%}. 

CONCLUSIONS
Prediction of CHD from genomic data is feasible, and can be applied for risk management of CHD and early selection for genetic improvement to reduce the prevalence of CHD in breeding programs. The prediction can be implemented before maturity, at which age current radiographic screening programs are traditionally applied, and as soon as DNA is available.},

abstract = {Genetic variation among the individuals in a population, in the sense that some individuals have different genotypes at one or more gene loci than do others, is necessary for evolution by natural selection. Many aspects of genetic variation are therefore of interest, in particular the extent, nature, pattern, and causes of this variation and the relation between this variation and the consequent phenotypic variation. Despite this, perhaps surprisingly little is known about important aspects of genetic variation. On the other hand, current techniques, including that of deep sequencing, are revealing more information about these matters, and thus the study of various aspects of genetic variation is currently very active.},

abstract = {Germ-line and somatic mutations in genes that promote homology-directed repair (HDR), especially BRCA1 and BRCA2, are frequently observed in several cancers, in particular, breast and ovary but also prostate and other cancers. HDR is critical for the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other lesions, and HDR factors also protect stalled replication forks. As a result, loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 poses significant risks to genome integrity, leading not only to cancer predisposition but also to sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, affecting therapeutic approaches. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2, including how they genetically interact with other repair factors, how they protect stalled replication forks, how they affect the response to aldehydes, and how loss of their functions links to mutation signatures. Importantly, given the recent advances with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) for the treatment of HDR-deficient tumors, we discuss mechanisms by which BRCA-deficient tumors acquire resistance to PARPi and other agents.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Public Library of Science. All rights reserved. Gir is one of the main cattle breeds raised in tropical South American countries. Strong artificial selection through its domestication resulted in increased genetic differentiation among the countries in recent years. Over the years, genomic studies in Gir have become more common. However, studies of population structure and signatures of selection in divergent Gir populations are scarce and need more attention to better understand genetic differentiation, gene flow, and genetic distance. Genotypes of 173 animals selected for growth traits and 273 animals selected for milk production were used in this study. Clear genetic differentiation between beef and dairy populations was observed. Different criteria led to genetic divergence and genetic differences in allele frequencies between the two populations. Gene segregation in each population was forced by artificial selection, promoting isolation, and increasing genetic variation between them. Results showed evidence of selective forces in different regions of the genome. A total of 282 genes were detected under selection in the test population based on the fixation index (Fst), integrated haplotype score (iHS), and cross-population extend haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH) approaches. The QTL mapping identified 35 genes associated with reproduction, milk composition, growth, meat and carcass, health, or body conformation traits. The investigation of genes and pathways showed that quantitative traits associated to fertility, milk production, beef quality, and growth were involved in the process of differentiation of these populations. These results would support further investigations of population structure and differentiation in the Gir breed.},

To date, at least 12 purebred dog breeds have been found to be affected by this mutation. The aim of this study was to update information about the prevalence of ABCB1 mutation (c.227{\_}230delATAG) in predisposed breeds in multiple European countries. This large scale survey also includes countries which were not involved in previous studies. The samples were collected in the period from 2012 to 2014. The overview is based on genotyping data of 4729 individuals. The observed mutant allele frequencies were 58.5{\%} (Smooth Collie), 48.3{\%} (Rough Col-lie), 35{\%} (Australian Shepherd), 30.3{\%} (Shetland Sheepdog), 28.1{\%} (Silken Windhound), 26.1{\%} (Miniature Australian Shepherd), 24.3{\%} (Longhaired Whippet), 16.2{\%} (White Swiss Shepherd) and 0{\%} (Border Collie). The possible presence of an ABCB1 mutant allele in Akita-Inu breed has been investigated with negative results. This information could be helpful for breeders in optimization of their breeding strategy and for veterinarians when prescribing drug therapy for dogs of predisposed breeds.},

abstract = {Background. In canine genetics, the impact of population structure on whole genome association studies is typically addressed by sampling approximately equal numbers of cases and controls from dogs of a single breed, usually from the same country or geographic area. However one way to increase the power of genetic studies is to sample individuals of the same breed but from different geographic areas, with the expectation that independent meiotic events will have shortened the presumed ancestral haplotype around the mutation differently. Little is known, however, about genetic variation among dogs of the same breed collected from different geographic regions. Methodology/Principal Findings. In this report, we address the magnitude and impact of genetic diversity among common breeds sampled in the U.S. and Europe. The breeds selected, including the Rottweiler, Bernese mountain dog, flat-coated retriever, and golden retriever, share susceptibility to a class of soft tissue cancers typified by malignant histiocytosis in the Bernese mountain dog. We genotyped 722 SNPs at four unlinked loci (between 95 and 271 per locus) on canine chromosome 1 (CFA1). We showed that each population is characterized by distinct genetic diversity that can be correlated with breed history. When the breed studied has a reduced intra-breed diversity, the combination of dogs from international locations does not increase the rate of false positives and potentially increases the power of association studies. However, over-sampling cases from one geographic location is more likely to lead to false positive results in breeds with significant genetic diversity. Conclusions. These data provide new guidelines for association studies using purebred dogs that take into account population structure. {\textcopyright} 2007 Quignon et al.},

abstract = {Background The determination of altered expression of genes in specific tumor types and their effect upon cellular processes may create insight in tumorigenesis and help to design better treatments. The Flatcoated retriever is a dog breed with an exceptionally high incidence of histiocytic sarcomas. The breed develops two distinct entities of histiocytic neoplasia, a soft tissue form and a visceral form. Gene expression studies of these tumors have value for comparable human diseases such as histiocytic/dendritic cell sarcoma for which knowledge is difficult to accrue due to their rare occurrence. In addition, such studies may help in the search for genetic aberrations underlying the genetic predisposition in this dog breed. Methods Microarray analysis and pathway analyses were performed on fresh-frozen tissues obtained from Flatcoated retrievers with localized, soft tissue histiocytic sarcomas (STHS) and disseminated, visceral histiocytic sarcomas (VHS) and on normal canine spleens from various breeds. Expression differences of nine genes were validated with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses. Results QPCR analyses identified the significantly altered expression of nine genes; PPBP, SpiC, VCAM1, ENPEP, ITGAD (down-regulated), and GTSF1, Col3a1, CD90 and LUM (up-regulated) in the comparison of both the soft tissue and the visceral form with healthy spleen. DAVID pathway analyses revealed 24 pathways that were significantly involved in the development of HS in general, most of which were involved in the DNA repair and replication process. Conclusions This study identified altered expression of nine genes not yet implicated in histiocytic sarcoma manifestations in the dog nor in comparable human histiocytic/dendritic sarcomas. Exploration of the downside effect of canine inbreeding strategies for the study of similar sarcomas in humans might also lead to the identification of genes related to these rare malignancies in the human.},

abstract = {Wright's F-statistics, and especially F ST , provide important insights into the evolutionary processes that influence the structure of genetic variation within and among populations, and they are among the most widely used descriptive statistics in population and evolutionary genetics. Estimates of F ST can identify regions of the genome that have been the target of selection, and comparisons of F ST from different parts of the genome can provide insights into the demographic history of populations. For these reasons and others, F ST has a central role in population and evolutionary genetics and has wide applications in fields that range from disease association mapping to forensic science. This Review clarifies how F ST is defined, how it should be estimated, how it is related to similar statistics and how estimates of F ST should be interpreted. Nearly every plant or animal species includes many partially isolated populations.

abstract = {Cancer is a common problem in dogs and although all breeds of dog and crossbred dogs may be affected, it is notable that some breeds of pedigree dogs appear to be at increased risk of certain types of cancer suggesting underlying genetic predisposition to cancer susceptibility. Although the aetiology of most cancers is likely to be multifactorial, the limited genetic diversity seen in purebred dogs facilitates genetic linkage or association studies on relatively small populations as compared to humans, and by using newly developed resources, genome-wide association studies in dog breeds are proving to be a powerful tool for unravelling complex disorders. This paper will review the literature on canine breed susceptibility to histiocytic sarcoma, osteosarcoma, haemangiosarcoma, mast cell tumours, lymphoma, melanoma, and mammary tumours including the recent advances in knowledge through molecular genetic, cytogenetic, and genome wide association studies.},

abstract = {Despite the growing interest in circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) analysis in various clinical fields, especially oncology and prenatal diagnosis, few studies on sample handling have been reported and no analytical consensus is available. The lack of consistency between the various protocols for sample handling and the techniques used for ccfDNA analysis is one of the major obstacles in translating ccfDNA analysis to clinical practice. Although this point is highlighted regularly in the published reviews on ccfDNA analysis, no standard operating procedure currently exists despite several ongoing clinical studies on ccfDNA analysis.This review examines the preanalytical parameters potentially affecting ccfDNA concentration and fragmentation at each preanalytical step from blood drawing to the storage of ccfDNA extracts.Analysis of data in the literature and our own observations revealed the influence of preanalytical factors on ccfDNA analysis. Based on these data, we determined the optimal preanalytical protocols for ccfDNA analysis and ultimately, a guideline for the translation of ccfDNA analysis in routine clinical practice. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Examination of gene functions in specific tumor types improves insight in tumorigenesis and helps design better treatments. Due to the rarity of histiocytic/dendritic cell sarcoma in humans, it is difficult to accrue such knowledge. Therefore, comparative research of these cancers in predisposed dog breeds, such as the Flatcoated retriever, can be of value. Histiocytic sarcoma in the dog can be grouped into a soft tissue- and visceral form. The soft tissue form at first is localized, while the visceral form progresses more quickly to a terminal state, which might be related to variations in gene expression. Microarray analyses were performed on fresh-frozen tissue from Flatcoated retrievers with either soft tissue- or visceral histiocytic sarcoma. Expression differences of ten most significantly differentially expressed genes were validated with quantitative real-time PCR (q PCR) analyses. Q PCR analyses confirmed the significantly aberrant expression of three of the selected genes: C6 was up-regulated; CLEC12A and CCL5 were down-regulated in the visceral histiocytic sarcoma compared to the soft tissue form. The findings of our study indicate that these two forms of histiocytic sarcoma in the dog display a variation in gene expression and warrant analysis of functional changes in the expression of those genes in these rare sarcomas in man.},

abstract = {Activating mutations of the BRAF gene lead to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. Although many human cancers carry the mutated BRAF gene, this mutation has not yet been characterized in canine cancers. As human and canine cancers share molecular abnormalities, we hypothesized that BRAF gene mutations also exist in canine cancers. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced the exon 15 of BRAF, mutation hot spot of the gene, in 667 canine primary tumors and 38 control tissues. Sequencing analysis revealed that a single nucleotide T to A transversion at nucleotide 1349 occurred in 64 primary tumors (9.6{\%}), with particularly high frequency in prostatic carcinoma (20/25, 80{\%}) and urothelial carcinoma (30/45, 67{\%}). This mutation results in the amino acid substitution of glutamic acid for valine at codon 450 (V450E) of canine BRAF, corresponding to the most common BRAF mutation in human cancer, V600E. The evolutional conservation of the BRAF V600E mutation highlights the importance of MAPK pathway activation in neoplasia and may offer opportunity for molecular diagnostics and targeted therapeutics for dogs bearing BRAF-mutated cancers.},

abstract = {Histiocytic malignancies in both humans and dogs are rare and poorly understood. While canine histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is uncommon in the general domestic dog population, there is a strikingly high incidence in a subset of breeds, suggesting heritable predisposition. Molecular cytogenetic profiling of canine HS in these breeds would serve to reveal recurrent DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) that are breed and/or tumor associated, as well as defining those shared with human HS. This process would identify evolutionarily conserved cytogenetic changes to highlight regions of particular importance to HS biology. Using genome wide array comparative genomic hybridization we assessed CNAs in 104 spontaneously occurring HS from two breeds of dog exhibiting a particularly elevated incidence of this tumor, the Bernese Mountain Dog and Flat-Coated Retriever. Recurrent CNAs were evaluated further by multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization and loss of heterozygosity analyses. Statistical analyses were performed to identify CNAs associated with tumor location and breed. Almost all recurrent CNAs identified in this study were shared between the two breeds, suggesting that they are associated more with the cancer phenotype than with breed. A subset of recurrent genomic imbalances suggested involvement of known cancer associated genes in HS pathogenesis, including deletions of the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A/B, RB1 and PTEN. A small number of aberrations were unique to each breed, implying that they may contribute to the major differences in tumor location evident in these two breeds. The most highly recurrent canine CNAs revealed in this study are evolutionarily conserved with those reported in human histiocytic proliferations, suggesting that human and dog HS share a conserved pathogenesis. The breed associated clinical features and DNA copy number aberrations exhibited by canine HS offer a valuable model for the human counterpart, providing additional evidence towards elucidation of the pathophysiological and genetic mechanisms associated with histiocytic malignancies. Extrapolation of data derived from canine histiocytic disorders to human histiocytic proliferation may help to further our understanding of the propagation and cancerization of histiocytic cells, contributing to development of new and effective therapeutic modalities for both species.},

abstract = {The aims of this study were to assess genetic variances, trends and mode of inheritance for hip and elbow dysplasia in Finnish dog populations. The influence of time-dependent fixed effects in the model when estimating the genetic trends was also studied. Official hip and elbow dysplasia screening records of 42 421 dogs from seven breeds were analysed with REML. To investigate the mode of inheritance of hip and elbow dysplasia, trait distributions, genetic variances and regressions of offspring phenotypes on parental predicted breeding values were studied separately in males and in females. Genetic trends for hip dysplasia between the years 1983 and 1998 were favourable only in the Rottweiler. In elbow dysplasia, the trends were favourable after the year 1992 in all the four breeds studied but the overall changes were small. The reason for this seemed to be negligible selection pressure against these traits. Time-dependent fixed effects in the model had an influence on the estimated genetic trends, resulting either in a more negative or more positive genetic trend compared with the model from which the time-dependent effects were removed. Mitochondrial or sex-linked inheritance did not seem likely in the expression of hip and elbow dysplasia in the populations studied. Regression coefficients of offspring phenotypes on estimated parental breeding values were approximately equal to their expected value in a situation with equal parental contribution. Furthermore, the phenotypic frequency distributions of hip and elbow dysplasia grades were similar among males and females in each breed studied. No indication of major genes was found in the offspring frequency distributions within individual sires. According to these Finnish data, mode of inheritance for both hip and elbow dysplasia is polygenic (quantitative) with equal expression of the genes from both parents, although the estimates of heritability for hip dysplasia in the Rough Collie and for elbow dysplasia in the German Shepherd and the Golden Retriever were somewhat different in males compared with females.},

abstract = {Patellar luxation is an orthopedic disorder in which the patella moves out of its normal location within the femoral trochlea of the knee and it can lead to osteoarthritis, lameness, and pain. In dogs it is a heritable trait, with both environmental and genetic factors contributing to the phenotype. The prevalence of patellar luxation in the Dutch Flat-Coated Retriever population is 24{\%}. In this study, we investigated the molecular genetics of the disorder in this population. Genome-wide association analysis of 15,823 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 45 cases and 40 controls revealed that patellar luxation was significantly associated with a region on chromosome CFA07, and possibly with regions on CFA03, CFA31, and CFA36. The exons of the genes in these regions, 0.5 Mb combined, were analyzed further. These exons from 15 cases and a pooled sample from 15 controls were enriched using custom genomic hybridization arrays and analyzed by massive parallel DNA sequencing. In total 7257 variations were detected. Subsequently, a selection of 144 of these SNPs were genotyped in 95 Flat-Coated Retrievers. Nine SNPs, in eight genes on CFA07 and CFA31, were associated with patellar luxation (P {\textless}10-4). Genotyping of these SNPs in samples from a variety of breeds revealed that the disease-associated allele of one synonymous SNP in a pseudogene of FMO6 was unique to Flat-Coated Retrievers. Genome-wide association analysis followed by targeted DNA sequencing identified loci on chromosomes 7 and 31 as being involved in patellar luxation in the Flat-Coated Retriever breed.},

abstract = {Mitotic index (MI) is an indirect measure of cell proliferation that has been demonstrated to be a strong predictor of outcome for several human and canine cancers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of MI as a predictor of biologic behavior and survival in dogs with cutaneous mast cell tumors (MCTs). Medical records from 148 dogs with histologically confirmed MCTs were reviewed. Information regarding tumor grade, local recurrence, metastatic disease, date of death/last follow-up, and outcome was obtained. The region of the tumor with the highest overall mitotic activity was chosen for evaluation, and the MI value was defined as the number of mitotic figures/10 high-power fields (4003, 2.7 mm 2). A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to compare MI with survival data. A Mann-Whitney test was used to compare MI on the basis of the development of local recurrence and metastatic disease. The MI correlated directly with tumor grade (P , .0001). The median survival time for dogs with an MI {\#}5 was significantly longer (70 months) than for those with an MI .5 (2 months), regardless of grade (P , .001). For grade II tumors with an MI {\#}5, the median survival time (MST) was 70 months, compared with 5 months for those with an MI .5 (P , .001). For grade III tumors with an MI {\#}5, the MST was not reached, compared with ,2 months for those with an MI .5 (P , .001). In conclusion, MI is a strong predictor of overall survival for dogs with cutaneous MCTs and should be included as a prognostic indicator when determining therapeutic options.},

abstract = {Objectives: To study the ability of a stabilizing reagent to prevent cellular DNA contamination of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma during whole blood sample storage and shipping. Design and methods: Samples were drawn from healthy donors into K3EDTA and Cell-Free DNA BCTs (BCT) and stored at room temperature (RT). Aliquots were removed at specified time points and cfDNA was purified from the plasma. A Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) assay that amplifies a short $\beta$-actin gene fragment (136bp) was used to measure the total plasma cfDNA (pDNA) concentration while a longer $\beta$-actin fragment (420bp) was used to quantify genomic DNA (gDNA). In a follow-up experiment, blood samples drawn into the same types of tubes were shipped round trip by overnight air before cfDNA was isolated and analyzed. Results: Blood stored in K3EDTA tubes at RT showed increases in pDNA and gDNA concentrations over time. However, both pDNA and gDNA levels remained stable in BCT for at least seven days. On day 14, there was a 4.5-fold increase in pDNA in BCT as compared to {\textgreater}200-fold increase in K3EDTA tubes. Likewise, gDNA increased {\textless}2-fold on day 14 in BCT as opposed to a 456-fold increase in K3EDTA tubes. Similar results were observed after samples were shipped. Conclusions: Cell-Free DNA BCTs prevent gDNA contamination that may occur due to nucleated cell disruption during sample storage and shipping. This novel blood collection tube provides a method for obtaining stable cfDNA samples for rare target detection and accurate analysis while mitigating the threat of gDNA contamination. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

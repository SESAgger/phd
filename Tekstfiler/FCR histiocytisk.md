**General notes** *Roman numerals*

[^i]: High levels in spleen, so maybe not downregulated, just lower level than spleen (which Express it a lot).
[^ii]: Regulate growth and diff of early B-cells
[^iii]: Marker for stem cells
[^iv]: The function of lumican - a member of the family of small leucine rich proteoglycans - in the organization of the extracellular matrix composition as well as in migration and proliferation- in relation to the observed overexpression in HS warrants further investigations, including the site of overexpression (tumor cell or tumor-associated fibroblasts)
[^v]: Telomer del: CDKN2A interacting protein (CDKN2AIP), FAT tumor suppressor homolog1 (FAT1), Tumor suppressor candidate 3 (TUSC3), Mitochondrial Tumor Suppressor gene 1 (MTUS1) and pericentriolar material-1 (PCM1). Of comparative significance specific to HS, CDKN2AIP is known to interact with CDKN2A/p14ARF, TP53/p53 and MDM2
[^vi]: Also differences between localised and visceral disease
[^vii]: BRAFV600E mutation in all cases

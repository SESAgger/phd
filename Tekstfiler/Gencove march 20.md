# Investigation of missed SNPs

In order to investigate if the missed SNPs are the same for the samples, stuff was done:

1. Each position was counted across cases for both FCR and for all combined.

2. The mean and median was calculated, focus only on 174k SNP. When looking at all SNPs, the mean and median=1

   1. All combined (n=6)

      1. Mean: 4 and Median: 4 , 50% of the missed snps are present in at least 2/3 of dogs

   2. FCR (n=4)

      1. Mean: 3.1 and Median: 4. 50% of the missed snps are present in at least 3/4 of dogs

   3. Per chromosome (fcr only)

      1. Mean within the range 

         1. 2.7-3.4, so for each chromosome 50% of the SNPs have been missed in 68% of cases

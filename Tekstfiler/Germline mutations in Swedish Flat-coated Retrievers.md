# Germline mutations in Swedish Flat-coated Retrievers

**Introduction:** Flat-coated retrievers are prone to develop several different diseases, most notably histiocytic sarcoma. Interestingly this tendency is not seen in Golden Retrievers, a closely related breed. 

**Aim:** This study aims characterize germline variation in Flat-coated Retrievers and compare it to Golden Retrievers and other European breeds by F-statistics and pooled heterozygosity.

**Methods:** Whole-genome sequencing of 19 Flat-coated Retrievers was performed and analyzed with a modified version of the K9-pipeline developed at Uppsala University. F-statistics and pooled heterogozity was performed with PLINK 1.91. The control group consists of 160 dogs of several different breeds. GO-analysis was performed using Panther with several different settings. Fixation index was calculated for both single SNPs, as well as windowed version with different settings.

**Results:** 373 genes was found to have SNPs present, with a fixation index more than 5 standard deviations away from the mean when compared to all 160 breeds. In addition, GO analysis of these genes, show enrichment of genes related to neuronal and cell membrane function. Several SNPs was found to have a fixation index of more than 5.5 standard deviations away from the mean, some of these were found in 2 genes: NBL1 and TBC1D32. 

**Conclusion:** Several SNPs seem to be fixated in the breed. Some of these a located in genes known to be associated with cancer, such as FOXP1. In addition, an enrichment of genes related to neuronal function and cell membrane function, seems to be present in this subset of genes. 

NBL1 might be is associated with neuroblastoma and TBC1D32 are associated with Orofaciodigital Syndrome as well as some cancers, even though the effect is still disputed. Flat-coated Retrievers have very distinct facial anatomy, which might be explained by mutations in TBC1D32. Further studies into the functional effect of the mutations in these genes are warranted.

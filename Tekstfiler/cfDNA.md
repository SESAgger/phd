It is important to note that heparin tubes are not typically compatible with ctDNA detection methods because in our experience the effect ofheparin on polymerase activity can severely impact sensitivity<br />An alterna- tive are the cell-free DNA BCT tubes from Streck. These are advertised to prevent lysis at ambient temperature for up to two weeks but weand others have noted that processing within a week or less is more appropriate to minimize contamination |

The skeletal actions of androgens may be mediated directly via the androgen receptor (AR) or indirectly via the estrogen receptor after aromatization to estrogens. The presence of androgen receptors has been demonstrated in bone cells and chondrocytes in vitro, but their presence in human bone in situ has not been reported. In order to provide further evidence for a direct action of androgens on bone via androgen receptors, we have used specific monoclonal antibodies to investigate the expression of human AR in normal developing and osteophytic bone of both sexes. In the growth plates from the developing bone, androgen receptors were predominantly expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes and in osteoblasts at sites of bone formation. They were also observed in osteocytes in the bone, and in mononuclear cells and endothelial cells of blood vessels within the bone marrow. In the osteophytes, androgen receptors were widely distributed at sites of endochondral ossification in proliferating, mature, and hypertrophic chondrocytes and at sites of bone remodeling in osteoblasts. They were also expressed in osteocytes and mononuclear cells within the bone marrow. The pattern and number of cells expressing the receptor was similar in both sexes. Our results show for the first time the presence and distribution of androgen receptors in normal developing human and osteophytic bone in situ and further provide evidence for a direct action of androgens on bone and cartilage cells.},

  abstract = {The size, shape, and behavior of the modern domesticated dog has been sculpted by artificial selection for at least 14,000 years. The genetic substrates of selective breeding, however, remain largely unknown. Here, we describe a genome-wide scan for selection in 275 dogs from 10 phenotypically diverse breeds that were genotyped for over 21,000 autosomal SNPs. We identified 155 genomic regions that possess strong signatures of recent selection and contain candidate genes for phenotypes that vary most conspicuously among breeds, including size, coat color and texture, behavior, skeletal morphology, and physiology. In addition, we demonstrate a significant association between HAS2 and skin wrinkling in the Shar-Pei, and provide evidence that regulatory evolution has played a prominent role in the phenotypic diversification of modern dog breeds. Our results provide a first-generation map of selection in the dog, illustrate how such maps can rapidly inform the genetic basis of canine phenotypic variation, and provide a framework for delineating the mechanistic basis of how artificial selection promotes rapid and pronounced phenotypic evolution.},

A classification of coccidioidomycosis is listed and two cases from Finland are presented. The first patient had typical X-ray and clinical findings, including a positive coccidioidin test. The second case, occurring soon after a visit to Arizona, was confirmed by positive fungal cultures from the sputum and from a resected specimen. Because the latter patient became pregnant and the risk of dissemination was considered great, legal abortion was performed. The resection of the pulmonary cavitation with infiltration around it took place under coverage of pre- and postoperative amphotericin B medication. Complete recovery was obtained. The indications for thoracic surgery are briefly listed. Diagnostic and mycologic aspects of this rare and exotic disease are discussed. Among other things, the importance of a good medical history in finding the contact with infective environment or material is stressed.},

  abstract = {Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG), and Erdheim\textendash Chester disease (ECD) represent histiocytic disorders with a wide range of clinical manifestations. Until recently, mechanisms of pathogenesis have been speculative and debate has focused on classification of these conditions as reactive versus neoplastic. Genomic studies have been challenged by scarce tissue specimens, as well as heterogeneous nature of the lesions with variable infiltration of pathologic histiocytes. Whole-exome sequencing recently revealed a very low frequency of somatic mutations in LCH, JXG, and ECD compared to other neoplastic disorders. However, at least in the cases of LCH and ECD, there is a very high frequency of activating mutations in MAPK pathway genes, most notably BRAF-V600E, as well as MAP2K1, in LCH and NRAS in ECD. In ECD, recurrent mutations in the PI3K pathway gene PIK3CA have also been described. The heterogeneous clinical manifestations of these disorders may therefore be the cumulative result of activation of MAPK mutations (along with modifying signals from other pathways) at distinct stages of myeloid differentiation. Implications of this model include redefinition of LCH, JXG, and ECD as a group of clinically diverse myeloid neoplastic disorders with a common mechanism of pathogenesis. This model supports refocusing therapeutic strategies for these diseases on a personalized approach based on specific mutations and the cell(s) of origin.},

Loss of mechanisms that regulate bFGF activity could result in tumor development. To test this idea, cells derived from an invasive bladder carcinoma (EJ) were compared with cells derived from a noninvasive bladder carcinoma (RT4) for the expression of bFGF and high and low affinity FGF receptors. bFGF was produced by the invasive EJ cells but not by the noninvasive RT4 cells, suggesting that bFGF could act in an autocrine fashion in the EJ cells to promote their invasion and growth in the surrounding tissue. The two cells lines also showed differences in FGF receptor expression. The EJ cells expressed both high and low affinity FGF receptors as determined by Scatchard analysis, whereas the RT4 cells expressed only high affinity receptors. The high affinity receptors on the RT4 cells expressed recognized by an antibody to known FGF receptors. Furthermore, in contrast to the EJ cells, bFGF did not induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the RT4 cells. Thus these data suggest that the invasive potential of bladder carcinoma cells may be regulated by the expression of both bFGF and its receptors. \textcopyright{} 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {The cancer genomics revolution has rapidly expanded the inventory of somatic mutations characterizing human malignancies, highlighting a previously underappreciated extent of molecular variability between and within patients. Also in breast cancer, the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women, this heterogeneity complicates the understanding of the stepwise sequence of pathogenic events and the design of effective and long-lasting target therapies. To disentangle this complexity and pinpoint which molecular perturbations are crucial to hijack the cellular machinery and lead to tumorigenesis and drug resistance, functional studies are needed in model systems that faithfully and comprehensively recapitulate all the salient aspects of their cognate human counterparts. Mouse models of breast cancer have been instrumental for the study of tumor initiation and drug response but also involve cost and time limitations that represent serious bottlenecks in translational research. To keep pace with the overwhelming amount of hypotheses that warrant in vivo testing, continuous refinement of current breast cancer models and implementation of new technologies is crucial. In this review, we summarize the current state of the art in modeling human breast cancer in mice, and we put forward our vision for future developments.},

(CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) ABSTRACT. Canine histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is a malignancy originating from the histiocytic cell lineage and characterized by poor response to chemotherapy and short survival time. Mutation of the TP53 gene and its association with poor prognosis has been reported in several canine tumors. However, the mutation of this gene has not been investigated in canine HS. The aim of this study was to examine a TP53 gene mutation in dogs with HS. Aberrations of the TP53 gene were examined by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and DNA sequence analysis, revealing mutations of the TP53 gene in 12 (46\%) of 26 dogs affected by HS. The incidence of the TP53 gene mutation was relatively high in canine HS compared with other canine tumors. Among these mutations, 10 of 12 dogs (83\%) with a TP53 gene mutation harbored the same mutation: a 2-base (AT) insertion in exon 5, resulting in the introduction of a stop codon (c.446\_447insAT, p.Tyr150SerfsX8). Further studies are needed to examine the functional change due to the mutation and its association with the pathogenesis of canine HS. Canine histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is a rare neoplasm originating from histiocytic cell lineages, including dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages [1, 7]. HS arises from interstitial DCs and is subdivided into two categories: localized and disseminated HS. In addition, a third subtype, hemophagocytic HS, that arises from macrophages, was recently described [7]. HS is characterized by aggressive biological behavior and dogs with HS have poor prognosis. Although there have been several reports describing its response to doxorubicin [14], liposomal doxorubicin [14] and paclitaxel [10], treatment with lomustine (CCNU) is selected in most cases based on the reported response rates [11-13]; however, HS often acquires chemotherapy resistance within a short time, which leads to a median survival time of less than 100 days in these study. Therefore, further study is needed to understand the pathogenesis to develop more effective therapeutic strategy for canine HS. p53, encoded by a tumor suppressor gene, TP53 [6], functions as a transcription factor that regulates gene expression that promotes apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. Mutation of the TP53 gene is known to result in tumorigenesis and drug resistance [8, 16]. In humans, TP53 is the most frequently altered gene in tumor cells and more than 50\% of all patients with tumors carry TP53 gene mutations [9]. As is the case with human tumors, mutations of the TP53 gene have been reported in several canine tumors, including osteosarcoma [4], lymphoma [5], mammary tumors [15] and brain tumors [17], and the proportions of patients with TP53 mutation in each tumor were 40.7, 16, 15 and 3.4\%, respectively. Recently, we reported that three of four canine HS cell lines had aberrations of the TP53 gene, and it was suggested that the TP53 gene might be frequently mutated in canine HS [2]. However, there have been no reports of TP53 gene mutations in primary canine HS tissues. The objectives of this study were to examine a TP53 gene mutation in canine HS for the elucidation of its pathogenesis.},

The precise timing and location of this event is debated and little is known about the genetic changes that accompanied the transformation of ancient wolves into domestic dogs. Here we conduct whole-genome resequencing of dogs and wolves to identify 3.8 million genetic variants used to identify 36 genomic regions that probably represent targets for selection during dog domestication. Nineteen of these regions contain genes important in brain function, eight of which belong to nervous system development pathways and potentially underlie behavioural changes central to dog domestication. Ten genes with key roles in starch digestion and fat metabolism also show signals of selection. We identify candidate mutations in key genes and provide functional support for an increased starch digestion in dogs relative to wolves. Our results indicate that novel adaptations allowing the early ancestors of modern dogs to thrive on a diet rich in starch, relative to the carnivorous diet of wolves, constituted a crucial step in the early domestication of dogs. \textcopyright{} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In one cat, C1, cell-mediated immunity was depressed throughout the monitoring period but particularly from 125\textendash 200 weeks post-infection (pi), when this cat demonstrated profoundly impaired lymphocyte blastogenesis and markedly increased interleukin-1 (IL-1) production compared to age-matched, uninfected control cats. Lymphocyte function in the other cat, C2, was preserved to a greater degree. Alterations in the levels of immunoglobulin isotypes M, A and G in CD4+-, CD8+- and CD21+-lymphocyte sub-sets were demonstrated in both cats. Southern blot analysis revealed the presence of integrated FIV-provirus in tumour DNA from C2 but not C1 indicating a possible direct role for the virus in the former case only. In this study we have characterised, for the first time, the FIV-induced immune dysfunction in cats which developed lymphoma, demonstrating potential indirect mechanisms of tumourigenesis.},

  abstract = {The identification of signatures of natural selection in genomic surveys has become an area of intense research, stimulated by the increasing ease with which genetic markers can be typed. Loci identified as subject to selection may be functionally important, and hence (weak) candidates for involvement in disease causation. They can also be useful in determining the adaptive differentiation of populations, and exploring hypotheses about speciation. Adaptive differentiation has traditionally been identified from differences in allele frequencies among different populations, summarised by an estimate of F ST. Low outliers relative to an appropriate neutral population-genetics model indicate loci subject to balancing selection, whereas high outliers suggest adaptive (directional) selection. However, the problem of identifying statistically significant departures from neutrality is complicated by confounding effects on the distribution of F ST estimates, and current methods have not yet been tested in large-scale simulation experiments. Here, we simulate data from a structured population at many unlinked, diallelic loci that are predominantly neutral but with some loci subject to adaptive or balancing selection. We develop a hierarchical-Bayesian method, implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and assess its performance in distinguishing the loci simulated under selection from the neutral loci. We also compare this performance with that of a frequentist method, based on moment-based estimates of F ST. We find that both methods can identify loci subject to adaptive selection when the selection coefficient is at least five times the migration rate. Neither method could reliably distinguish loci under balancing selection in our simulations, even when the selection coefficient is twenty times the migration rate.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an overview of changes in the extreme events that are most likely to affect Europe in forthcoming decades. A variety of diagnostic methods are used to determine how heat waves, heavy precipitation, drought, wind storms, and storm surges change between present (1961\textendash 90) and future (2071\textendash 2100) climate on the basis of regional climate model simulations produced by the PRUDENCE project. A summary of the main results follows. Heat waves \textendash{} Regional surface warming causes the frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves to increase over Europe. By the end of the twenty first century, countries in central Europe will experience the same number of hot days as are currently experienced in southern Europe. The intensity of extreme temperatures increases more rapidly than the intensity of more moderate temperatures over the continental interior due to increases in temperature variability. Precipitation \textendash{} Heavy winter precipitation increases in central and northern Europe and decreases in the south; heavy summer precipitation increases in north-eastern Europe and decreases in the south. Mediterranean droughts start earlier in the year and last longer. Winter storms \textendash{} Extreme wind speeds increase between 45\textdegree N and 55\textdegree N, except over and south of the Alps, and become more north-westerly than cuurently. These changes are associated with reductions in mean sea-level pressure, leading to more North Sea storms and a corresponding increase in storm surges along coastal regions of Holland, Germany and Denmark, in particular. These results are found to depend to different degrees on model formulation. While the responses of heat waves are robust to model formulation, the magnitudes of changes in precipitation and wind speed are sensitive to the choice of regional model, and the detailed patterns of these changes are sensitive to the choice of the driving global model. In the case of precipitation, variation between models can exceed both internal variability and variability between different emissions scenarios.},

  abstract = {The development of noninvasive methods to detect and monitor tumors continues to be a major challenge in oncology. We used digital polymerase chain reaction\textendash based technologies to evaluate the ability of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect tumors in 640 patients with various cancer types. We found that ctDNA was detectable in {$>$}75\% of patients with advanced pancreatic, ovarian, colorectal, bladder, gastroesophageal, breast, melanoma, hepatocellular, and head and neck cancers, but in less than 50\% of primary brain, renal, prostate, or thyroid cancers. In patients with localized tumors, ctDNA was detected in 73, 57, 48, and 50\% of patients with colorectal cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and breast adenocarcinoma, respectively. ctDNA was often present in patients without detectable circulating tumor cells, suggesting that these two biomarkers are distinct entities. In a separate panel of 206 patients with metastatic colorectal cancers, we showed that the sensitivity of ctDNA for detection of clinically relevant KRAS gene mutations was 87.2\% and its specificity was 99.2\%. Finally, we assessed whether ctDNA could provide clues into the mechanisms underlying resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor blockade in 24 patients who objectively responded to therapy but subsequently relapsed. Twenty-three (96\%) of these patients developed one or more mutations in genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Together, these data suggest that ctDNA is a broadly applicable, sensitive, and specific biomarker that can be used for a variety of clinical and research purposes in patients with multiple different types of cancer. Circulating tumor DNA can be used in a variety of clinical and investigational settings across tumor types and stages for screening, diagnosis, and identifying mutations responsible for therapeutic response and drug resistance.

This approach is complicated because of the confounding effects that population demographic history and selection have on patterns of DNA sequence variation. In principle, multilocus analyses can facilitate robust inferences of selection at individual loci. The deluge of large-scale catalogs of genetic variation has stimulated many genome-wide scans for positive selection in several species. Here, we review some of the salient observations of these studies, identify important challenges ahead, consider the limitations of genome-wide scans for selection and discuss the potential significance of a comprehensive understanding of genomic patterns of selection for disease-related research. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the rarity of histiocytic/dendritic cell sarcoma in humans, it is difficult to accrue such knowledge. Therefore, comparative research of these cancers in predisposed dog breeds, such as the Flatcoated retriever, can be of value. Histiocytic sarcoma in the dog can be grouped into a soft tissue- and visceral form. The soft tissue form at first is localized, while the visceral form progresses more quickly to a terminal state, which might be related to variations in gene expression. Microarray analyses were performed on fresh-frozen tissue from Flatcoated retrievers with either soft tissue- or visceral histiocytic sarcoma. Expression differences of ten most significantly differentially expressed genes were validated with quantitative real-time PCR (q PCR) analyses. Q PCR analyses confirmed the significantly aberrant expression of three of the selected genes: C6 was up-regulated; CLEC12A and CCL5 were down-regulated in the visceral histiocytic sarcoma compared to the soft tissue form. The findings of our study indicate that these two forms of histiocytic sarcoma in the dog display a variation in gene expression and warrant analysis of functional changes in the expression of those genes in these rare sarcomas in man.},

  abstract = {Appendicular osteosarcoma is the most common malignant primary canine bone tumor. When treated by amputation or tumor removal alone, median survival times (MST) do not exceed 5\,months, with the majority of dogs suffering from metastatic disease. This period can be extended with adequate local intervention and adjuvant chemotherapy, which has become common practice. Several prognostic factors have been reported in many different studies, e.g. age, breed, weight, sex, neuter status, location of tumor, serum alkaline phosphatase (SALP), bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), infection, percentage of bone length affected, histological grade or histological subtype of tumor. Most of these factors are, however, only reported as confounding factors in larger studies. Insight in truly significant prognostic factors at time of diagnosis may contribute to tailoring adjuvant therapy for individual dogs suffering from osteosarcoma. The objective of this study was to systematically review the prognostic factors that are described for canine appendicular osteosarcoma and validate their scientific importance.},

  abstract = {Objective: To test the hypothesis that during the luteal phase of the human ovarian cycle, as compared with the follicular phase, the percentage of cytokines producing peripheral monocytes after in vitro stimulation with endotoxin is increased. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Academic research institution. Patient(s): Women with regular menstrual cycles. Intervention(s): Blood samples were collected between days 6 and 9 of the menstrual cycle (follicular phase) and between days 6 and 9 of the menstrual cycle following the LH surge (luteal phase). Main Outcome Measure(s): Percentages of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{$\alpha$}\textendash, interleukin (IL)-1{$\beta$}\textendash, and IL-12\textendash producing monocytes as well as total white blood cell (WBC) count, differential WBC counts, and plasma 17{$\beta$}-estradiol and progesterone concentrations. Result(s): Mean plasma 17{$\beta$}-estradiol and progesterone concentrations, percentage of TNF-{$\alpha$}\textendash{} and IL-1{$\beta$}\textendash producing monocytes, WBC counts, and granulocyte cell count were significantly increased in the luteal phase as compared with the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle. The percentage of IL-12\textendash producing monocytes, monocyte count and lymphocyte count did not vary between the 2 phases of the ovarian cycle. Conclusion(s): Together with an increase in progesterone and 17{$\beta$}-estradiol during the luteal phase, there is an increase in percentage TNF-{$\alpha$}\textendash{} and IL-1{$\beta$}\textendash producing peripheral monocytes after in vitro stimulation with endotoxin as compared with the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle. Whether this increased sensitivity of monocytes for proinflammatory stimuli during the luteal phase is due to increased plasma levels of progesterone or 17{$\beta$}-estradiol needs further investigation.},

  abstract = {Domestic dogs exhibit tremendous phenotypic diversity, including a greater variation in body size than any other terrestrial mammal. Here, we generate a high density map of canine genetic variation by genotyping 915 dogs from 80 domestic dog breeds, 83 wild canids, and 10 outbred African shelter dogs across 60,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Coupling this genomic resource with external measurements from breed standards and individuals as well as skeletal measurements from museum specimens, we identify 51 regions of the dog genome associated with phenotypic variation among breeds in 57 traits. The complex traits include average breed body size and external body dimensions and cranial, dental, and long bone shape and size with and without allometric scaling. In contrast to the results from association mapping of quantitative traits in humans and domesticated plants, we find that across dog breeds, a small number of quantitative trait loci ({$<$} or = 3) explain the majority of phenotypic variation for most of the traits we studied. In addition, many genomic regions show signatures of recent selection, with most of the highly differentiated regions being associated with breed-defining traits such as body size, coat characteristics, and ear floppiness. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of mapping multiple traits in the domestic dog using a database of genotyped individuals and highlight the important role human-directed selection has played in altering the genetic architecture of key traits in this important species.},

  abstract = {Evaluating the kinetics of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the blood of cancer patients could be a strong auxiliary component to the molecular characterization of cfDNA, but its potential clinical significance is obscured by the absence of an analytical consensus. To utilize quantitative cfDNA assessment with confidence, it is crucial that the preanalytical phase is standardized. In a previous publication, several preanalytical variables that may affect quantitative measurements of cfDNA were identified, and the most confounding variables were assessed further using the growth medium of cultured cancer cells as a source of cfDNA ("Cell-free DNA: Preanalytical variables" [1]). The data accompanying this report relates to these experiments, which includes numerous changes to the sample handling and isolation protocols, and can be used for the interpretation of these results and other similar experiments by different researchers.},

  abstract = {Since the discovery of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in human blood, most studies have focused on diagnostic and prognostic uses of these markers for solid tumors. Except for some prenatal tests and BEAMing, cfDNA analysis has not yet been translated to clinical practice and routine application appears distant. This can be attributed to overlapping factors: (i) a lack of knowledge regarding the origin and function of cfDNA, (ii) insufficient molecular characterization, and (iii) the absence of an analytical consensus. In this review, we address the latter determinant and focus specifically on quantitative analysis of cfDNA. While the literature reports limited value for a single quantitative assessment, cfDNA kinetic assessment will be an essential component to qualitative characterization. In order to establish quantitative analysis for accurate kinetic assessments, process optimization and standardization are crucial. This report elucidates the most confounding variables of each preanalytic step that must be considered for optimal analysis.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose Recent data suggest that percutaneous sclerotherapy is a safe alternative to surgery for treatment of aneurysmal bone cysts (ABCs). We present our experience of this method. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data from 38 consecutive patients treated with repeated injections of polidocanol. Each injection consisted of 2\textendash 4 mg polidocanol per kg body weight. Radiological and clinical assessments were performed until healing. Results All cycts except 1 healed after a median of 4 (1\textendash 11) injections. A lesion failed to heal in 1 patient, who was operated. 3 patients experienced minor local inflammatory reactions. Interpretation Our results show that percutaneus sclerotherapy with polidocanol has high efficacy in the treatment of ABCs, with a low frequency of side effects. Our findings corroborate data presented in previous publications. We believe that the method will be especially valuable in ABCs of the pelvis and sacrum, where surgery is associated with considerable morbidity.},

  abstract = {We studied how tumor necrosis-factor (TNF)-family proteins interact with osteoblasts to resolve several controversial points. We measured expression of TNFs, TNF-receptors, and nonsignaling (decoy) TNF receptors in human osteoblasts derived from mesenchymal stem cells and in MG63 human osteosarcoma cells using unamplified mRNA screening, with secondary Western or PCR analysis where indicated, and studied the effects of TNFs on osteoblasts in cell culture. Expression of TNFs and receptors was similar in MG63 cells and osteoblasts. TNF-R1 (p55), TRAIL receptor 1 and 2 (DR4 and 5), and Fas were expressed; RANK was undetectable. TNF-family ligands RANKL, TRAIL, and TNF{$\alpha$} were expressed, but mRNAs were typically at low levels relative to receptors, suggesting that osteoblastic TNF signals, including RANKL, require specific stimuli. Flow cytometry of MG63 cells confirmed TNF{$\alpha$} receptors and identified subpopulations with high surface-bound TNF{$\alpha$}. Decoy receptors expressed included a novel soluble form of TNFRSF25 (formerly DR3 or Apo3), implicated in rheumatoid-arthritis linkage studies, as well as osteoprotegerin, a well-characterized osteoblast protein that binds TRAIL and RANKL, and DcR2, which binds TRAIL. Osteoblast apoptosis was studied using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase labeling and annexin V binding. MG63 cells were resistant to apoptosis by exogenous TNF{$\alpha$} except when grown in media promoting osteoblast-like growth or matrix nodules. However, in media supporting osteoblast-like phenotype, apoptosis was induced by anti-Fas or TNF, in contrast to other studies with human osteoblasts. TRAIL caused cell retraction, supporting functional TRAIL response in cell differentiation, but did not cause apoptosis. We conclude that human osteoblasts have functional receptors for FasL, TNF{$\alpha$}, TRAIL, but not RANKL, and that osteoblasts are protected by multiple nonsignaling TNF receptors against destruction by TNF-family proteins under conditions favoring cell growth.},

  abstract = {Histopathology remains the cornerstone for diagnosing canine mammary tumors (CMTs). Recently, 2 classification systems (the World Health Organization [WHO] classification of 1999 and the proposal of 2011) and 2 grading methods based on the human Nottingham grade have been used by pathologists. Despite some evidence that the histological subtype and grade are prognostic factors, there is no comprehensive comparative study of these classification and grading systems in the same series of CMTs. In this study, the 2 classifications and the 2 grading methods were simultaneously applied to a cohort of 134 female dogs with CMTs. In 85 animals with malignant tumors, univariable and multivariable survival analyses were performed. Using the 2 systems, the proportion of benign (161/305, 53\%) and malignant (144/305, 47\%) tumors was similar and no significant differences existed in categorization of benign tumors. However, the 2011 classification subdivided malignant tumors in more categories-namely, those classified as complex, solid, and tubulopapillary carcinomas by the WHO system. Histological subtype according to both systems was significantly associated with survival. Carcinomas arising in benign tumors, complex carcinomas, and mixed carcinomas were associated with a better prognosis. In contrast, carcinosarcomas and comedocarcinomas had a high risk of tumor-related death. Slight differences existed between the 2 grading methods, and grade was related to survival only in univariable analysis. In this cohort, age, completeness of surgical margins, and 2 index formulas adapted from human breast cancer studies (including tumor size, grade, and vascular/lymph node invasion) were independent prognostic factors.},

The remaining 5 cats had long-term survival times of 11 months or greater. The median survival time was 11 months. Additional studies are warranted to better characterize EIL and its relationship to IBD in cats and non-EIL and to identify optimal treatment strategies for this disease.

  abstract = {PurposeWe previously found that 0.5\% polidocanol was more effective than tetracycline for pleurodesis in rats. Thus, we conducted the present study to evaluate the efficacy of different concentrations of polidocanol for pleurodesis in rats.MethodsWe divided 54 albino Wistar rats into six groups. Groups 1, 2, and 3 were given isotonic saline, 35 mg/kg tetracycline, and 0.6 mg of diluted polidocanol, respectively, being the daily recommended dose for humans. Groups 4, 5, and 6 were given 0.5\%, 1\%, and 2\% polidocanol, respectively. All solutions were given intrapleurally in a volume of 0.5 ml. We examined the rats for macroscopic pleural adhesions and compared the mean values of macroscopic scoring among the six groups.ResultsThe rats given polidocanol and tetracycline had significantly more adhesions than the control group, and polidocanol at concentrations of 0.5\%, 1\%, and 2\% was more effective for pleurodesis than tetracycline. The diluted polidocanol was not more effective than tetracycline. There was no difference between the effects of the 0.5\% and 1\% concentrations, but the 2\% polidocanol group had significantly more adhesions than the other groups.ConclusionsPolidocanol at concentrations of 0.5\%, 1\%, and 2\% was a more effective sclerosing agent than tetracycline for pleurodesis. While 2\% polidocanol was the most efficient sclerosing agent, the daily maximum recommended dose of polidocanol for humans was not more effective than tetracycline.},

BRAFV600E remains the only recurrent mutation reported in LCH. In order to evaluate the spectrum of somatic mutations in LCH, whole exome sequencing was performed on matched LCH and normal tissue samples obtained from 41 patients. Lesions from other histiocytic disorders, juvenile xanthogranuloma, Erdheim-Chester disease, and Rosai-Dorfman disease were also evaluated. All of the lesions from histiocytic disorders were characterized by an extremely low overall rate of somatic mutations. Notably, 33\% (7/21) of LCH cases with wild-type BRAF and none (0/20) with BRAFV600E harbored somatic mutations in MAP2K1 (6 in-frame deletions and 1 missense mutation) that induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in vitro. Single cases of somatic mutations of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway genes ARAF and ERBB3 were also detected. The ability of MAPK pathway inhibitors to suppress MAPK kinase and ERK phosphorylation in cell culture and primary tumor models was dependent on the specific LCH mutation. The findings of this study support a model in which ERK activation is a universal end point in LCH arising from pathological activation of upstream signaling proteins.},

HDR is critical for the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other lesions, and HDR factors also protect stalled replication forks. As a result, loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 poses significant risks to genome integrity, leading not only to cancer predisposition but also to sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, affecting therapeutic approaches. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2, including how they genetically interact with other repair factors, how they protect stalled replication forks, how they affect the response to aldehydes, and how loss of their functions links to mutation signatures. Importantly, given the recent advances with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) for the treatment of HDR-deficient tumors, we discuss mechanisms by which BRCA-deficient tumors acquire resistance to PARPi and other agents.},

We used next generation sequencing of two pools of 48 Norway spruce mother trees, one corresponding to the Fennoscandian domain, and the other to the Alpine domain, to assess nucleotide polymorphism at 88 nuclear genes. These genes are candidate genes for phenological traits, and most belong to the photoperiod pathway. Estimates of population genetic summary statistics from the pooled data are similar to previous estimates, suggesting that pooled sequencing is reliable. The nonsynonymous SNPs tended to have both lower frequency differences and lower FST values between the two domains than silent ones. These results suggest the presence of purifying selection. The divergence between the two domains based on synonymous changes was around 5~million~yr, a time similar to a recent phylogenetic estimate of 6~million~yr, but much larger than earlier estimates based on isozymes. Two approaches, one of them novel and that considers both FST and difference in allele frequencies between the two domains, were used to identify SNPs potentially under diversifying selection. SNPs from around 20 genes were detected, including genes previously identified as main target for selection, such as PaPRR3 and PaGI.},

Increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine\textendash biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells and DNA fragmentation in the penumbral zone were significantly reduced by 17 {$\beta$}-estradiol. In line with these results, 17 {$\beta$}-estradiol significantly increased Akt and cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) with increased Bcl-2 protein in the ischemic area, whereas the elevated the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome10 (PTEN) phosphorylation was significantly reduced with decreased Bax protein and cytochrome c release. Inhibition of DNA fragmentation, PTEN phosphorylation, and Akt activation by 17 {$\beta$}-estradiol were antagonized by iberiotoxin, a maxi-K channel blocker. Taken together, it is suggested that suppression of cerebral ischemic injury by 17 {$\beta$}-estradiol may be ascribed to the maxi-K channel opening-coupled downregulation of PTEN phosphorylation and upregulation of Akt and CREB phosphorylation with resultant increase in Bcl-2 protein and decrease in Bax protein and cytochrome c release.},

As the number of breast cancer patients increases with age, the majority of breast cancer patients are postmenopausal women. Although estrogens are no longer made in the ovaries after menopause, peripheral tissues produce sufficient concentrations to stimulate tumor growth. As aromatase catalyzes the final and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of estrogen, inhibitors of this enzyme are effective targeted therapy for breast cancer. Three aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are now FDA approved and have been shown to be more effective than the antiestrogen tamoxifen and are well tolerated. AIs are now a standard treatment for postmenopausal patients. AIs are effective in adjuvant and first-line metastatic setting. This review describes the development of AIs and their current use in breast cancer. Recent research focuses on elucidating mechanisms of acquired resistance that may develop in some patients with long term AI treatment and also on innate resistance. Preclinical data in resistance models demonstrated that the crosstalk between ER and other signaling pathways particularly MAPK and PI3K/Akt is an important resistant mechanism. Blockade of these other signaling pathways is an attractive strategy to circumvent the resistance to AI therapy in breast cancer.

The median plasma VEGF concentration for dogs with HSA was 17.2 pg/mL (range, {$<$}1.0\textemdash 66.7 pg/mL). Plasma VEGF concentrations in dogs with HSA did not correlate with stage of disease or tumor burden, but 1 dog had undetectable VEGF during chemotherapy that subsequently increased with disease progression.},

Both aromatase cytochrome P450 (P450arom) and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (reductase), the two essential components of the enzyme complex, are highly conserved among mammals and vertebrates. Aromatase expression occurs in the gonads and brain, and is essential for reproductive development and fertility. Of interest are the complex mechanisms involving alternative promoter utilization that have evolved to control tissue-specific expression in these tissues. In addition, in a number of species, including humans, expression of aromatase has a broader tissue distribution, including placenta, adipose and bone. The relevance of oestrogen synthesis and possibly androgen metabolism in these peripheral sites of expression is now becoming clear from studies in P450arom knockout (ArKO) mice and from genetic defects recognized recently in both men and women. Important species differences in the physiological roles of aromatase expression are also likely to emerge, despite the highly conserved nature of the enzyme system. The identification of functionally distinct, tissue-specific isozymes of P450arom in at least one mammal, pigs, and several species of fish indicates that there are additional subtle, but physiologically significant, species-specific roles for aromatase. Comparative studies of mammalian and other vertebrate aromatases will expand understanding of the role played by this ancient enzyme system in the evolution of reproduction and the adaptive influence of oestrogen synthesis on general health and well being.},

The purpose of this study was to review data and material received though an ongoing Flat Coated Retriever tumor survey to better define the presentation of HS in the breed and to determine the utility of subclassification of tumors arising at different sites by histology and immunohistologic phenotyping. Data on 180 dogs bearing HS-like tumors were available for review, which showed that although the majority (101 lesions, 57\%) were primary limb lesions, 47 dogs (26\%) had visceral, mainly splenic lesions with no peripheral primary tumor. A detailed histologic and immunohistologic review of 20 limb tumors and 20 splenic tumors showed that 2 distinct phenotypic subtypes could be identified: a histiocytic subtype, most prevalent in the splenic tumors, and a histiocytic-spindle-pleomorphic subtype, mainly seen in the limb tumors. Despite their variable morphology, all tumors expressed major histocompatibility complex class II and the leukocyte antigen CD18, but only those tumors in the spleen consistently expressed CD11d. The majority of tumors also contained a mild to moderate infiltrate of T lymphocytes.},

Data were collected by questionnaire from owners of 683 Rottweiler dogs living in North America.

Sixty cats with lymphosarcoma were identified and classified by anatomical location of the tumour. Data on breed, age, sex, clinical signs and diagnostic procedures were collated. Results The prevalence of feline lymphosarcoma in the hospital population was 0.84\%. Siamese cats appeared predisposed to lymphosarcoma but other purebreds were not. Males were somewhat overrepresented amongst affected cats. Similar numbers of cases (12 to 18) were seen in each of the four anatomic categories (multicentric, mediastinal, alimentary and extranodal). Cats with mediastinal lymphosarcoma were mostly young and Siamese. Clinical signs in affected cats were varied, usually multiple and often nonspecific. Two of 22 cases tested positive for feline leukaemia virus antigen in blood and 6 of 13 were positive for feline immunodeficiency virus antibody. Conclusions Extranodal lymphosarcoma seemed more prevalent in this study than reported elsewhere. Siamese cats in the study population may have had a genetic predisposition to lymphosarcoma. Limited evidence suggested feline leukaemia virus may be less important, and feline immunodeficiency virus more important, in the local population than indicated in overseas reports. Additional studies are needed to investigate breed predisposition and feline leukaemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus status in Australian cats with lymphosarcoma.},

This prospective study evaluates the effects of local anaesthetic (LA) and different gauge needles on the diagnostic accuracy of breast FNAC.\textbf{Methods:}Aspirates were obtained from 59 consecutive excised breast tumours (51 malignant, eight benign) using green (21-G) and blue-hub (23-G) needles, both before and after infiltration of LA at the aspiration site.\textbf{Results:}There was good agreement for the cytological diagnosis of each tumour when compared by needle size (\emph{{$\kappa$}}=0.85) and the presence of LA (\emph{{$\kappa$}}=0.77). Diagnostic sensitivity ranged from 88 to 92\%. None of the differences were statistically significant. In addition LA appeared to have no effect upon the cytological grading of breast carcinomas (\textsuperscript{2}=1.98,\emph{df}3,\emph{P}=0.58).\textbf{Discussion:}The use of the smaller gauge blue-hub needle or LA does not appear to affect adversely the diagnostic accuracy of breast FNAC. Whether using LA or the blue needle routinely in the breast clinic will have an effect upon the discomfort experienced during FNAC remains to be proven.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background: Breast fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is an invasive investigation which can be uncomfortable or distressing. This randomized study investigated the discomfort of breast FNAC and the effect of different techniques. Methods: Some 116 FNAC samples were taken from 98 women with a palpable breast mass. Each patient was randomized to one of four study groups; aspiration was performed using a green-hub (21 G) or blue-hub (23 G) needle, either with or without local anaesthetic. Each patient scored the pain of the whole procedure using a visual analogue scale. Results: A green-hub needle caused significantly more discomfort (mean(s.e.m.) pain score 5{$\cdot$}1(0{$\cdot$}4) cm) than a blue-hub needle (2{$\cdot$}9(0{$\cdot$}4) cm), or either a blue- or green-hub needle with local anaesthetic (3{$\cdot$}0(0{$\cdot$}4) and 2{$\cdot$}1(0{$\cdot$}4) cm respectively) (F = 10{$\cdot$}28, 3112 d.f., P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}01, analysis of variance). Conclusion: The discomfort of breast FNAC is dependent upon the gauge of the needle and the use of local anaesthetic. A blue-hub needle without local anaesthetic should be first choice for breast FNAC. \textcopyright{} 2000 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd},

The maximum proliferative effect of a single period of mechanical strain (3400 {$\mu\epsilon$}, 1 Hz, and 600 cycles) is additional to that of testosterone (10-8 M) or estrogen (10-8 M). The cells' proliferative response to strain is abolished both by concentrations of tamoxifen that cause proliferation (10-8 M) and by those that have no effect (10-6 M). Strain-related proliferation also is reduced by the estrogen antagonist ICI 182,780 (10-8 M) but is unaffected by the androgen receptor antagonist hydroxyflutamide (10-7 M). Tamoxifen, ICI 182,780, and the aromatase inhibitor 4-dihydroandrostenedione, at concentrations that have no effect on basal proliferation, significantly reduce the proliferative effect of the aromatizable androgen testosterone but not that of the nonaromatizable androgen 5{$\alpha$}-dihydrotestosterone. Hydroxyflutamide, at a concentration that has no effect on basal proliferation (10-7 M), eliminates the proliferative effect of 5{$\alpha$}-dihydro-testosterone but had no significant effect on that caused by testosterone. Proliferation associated with strain is blocked by neutralizing antibody to insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) but not by antibody to IGF-I. Proliferation associated with testosterone is blocked by neutralizing antibody to IGF-I but is unaffected by antibody to IGF-II. These data suggest that in rat osteoblast-like cells from males, as from females, strain-related proliferation is mediated through the estrogen receptor (ER) in a manner that does not compete with estrogen but that can be blocked by ER modulators. Proliferation associated with testosterone appears to follow its aromatization to estrogen and is mediated through the ER, whereas proliferation associated with 5{$\alpha$}-dihydrotestosterone is mediated by the androgen receptor.

The composition, dimension, and mechanical properties of intact bone as well as the constituent bone collagen from femoral diaphyses were investigated in relation to both age (9\textendash 24 months) and castration. Castration had no effect on density and only minor effect on ash and collagen contents. An age-related increase in bone mass, cross-sectional area, and wall thickness of the diaphyses was arrested (bone mass, area) or even reversed (to a decrease in wall thickness) after castration. Therefore, a growing difference, pronounced from 6 months after castration, between intact and castrated rats was observed in bone mass, cross-sectional area, and wall thickness. The compressive mechanical strength of intact bone normalized with regard to cross-sectional area was unaffected by castration, whereas castration tended to increase the stiffness of the bone collagen. When observed in a polarization microscope, two different zones in cross sections of the diaphyses were apparent. The average diameter of the border line separating the two zones was independent of age and castration. By measuring the average thickness of each of the two zones, age-related periosteal bone formation and endosteal bone resorption were demonstrated. After castration, the rate of bone formation was reduced and the rate of bone resorption was accelerated. Castration was thus found to affect the composition and the quality of the cortical bone to a minor extent only. On the other hand, the quantity of cortical bone was markedly reduced from 6 months after castration due to both an inhibited rate of bone formation and an accelerated rate of bone resorption.},

  abstract = {Domestic dogs are unique from other animal models of cancer in that they generally experience spontaneous disease. In addition, most types of cancer observed in humans are found in dogs, suggesting that canines may be an informative system for the study of cancer genetics. Domestic dogs are divided into over 175 breeds, with members of each breed sharing significant phenotypes. The breed barrier enhances the utility of the model, especially for genetic studies where small numbers of genes are hypothesized to account for the breed cancer susceptibility. These facts, combined with recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies allows for an unrivaled ability to use pet dog populations to find often subtle mutations that promote cancer susceptibility and progression in dogs as a whole. The meticulous record keeping associated with dog breeding makes the model still more powerful, as it facilitates both association analysis and family-based linkage studies. Key to the success of these studies is their cooperative nature, with owners, scientists, veterinarians and breed clubs working together to avoid the cost and unpopularity of developing captive populations. In this article we explore these principals and advocate for colony-free, genetic studies that will enhance our ability to diagnose and treat cancer in dogs and humans alike.},

In the remaining cases, little or no ossification was apparent but ossification may take 1 year or more to occur. No recurrence was observed in any of these cases. Recurrence occurred only in two cases. In one, growth of the recurrence stopped after a second embolization, and the X-rays showed no change. Selective arterial embolization represents a treatment of choice in aneurysmal bone cyst and angioma of bone especially of the spine, sacrum, or pelvis.

In the coding region of the PDE6G gene, exclusively healthy Labrador Retrievers showed an A \textrightarrow{} G transition in exon 4 without amino acid exchange. SNP were also observed in introns 1 and 2 in different dog breeds. The different SNP were used as intragenic markers to investigate the involvement of both genes in gPRA.

Stress-activated pathways, such as Jun N-terminal kinase and p38, largely seem to counteract malignant transformation. The balance and integration between these signals may widely vary in different tumours, but are important for the outcome and the sensitivity to drug therapy. \textcopyright{} 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Histiocytic neoplasms are clonal, hematopoietic disorders characterized by an accumulation of abnormal, monocyte-derived dendritic cells or macrophages in Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis (non-LCH), respectively. The discovery of BRAFV600E mutations in approximately 50\% of these patients provided the first molecular therapeutic target in histiocytosis. However, recurrent driving mutations in the majority of patients with BRAFV600E\textendash wild-type non-LCH are unknown, and recurrent cooperating mutations in non-MAP kinase pathways are undefined for the histiocytic neoplasms. Through combined whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing, we identified recurrent kinase fusions involving BRAF, ALK, and NTRK1, as well as recurrent, activating MAP2K1 and ARAF mutations in patients with BRAFV600E\textendash wild-type non-LCH. In addition to MAP kinase pathway lesions, recurrently altered genes involving diverse cellular pathways were identified. Treatment of patients with MAP2K1- and ARAF-mutated non-LCH using MEK and RAF inhibitors, respectively, resulted in clinical efficacy, demonstrating the importance of detecting and targeting diverse kinase alterations in these disorders. Significance: We provide the first description of kinase fusions in systemic histiocytic neoplasms and activating ARAF and MAP2K1 mutations in non-Langerhans histiocytic neoplasms. Refractory patients with MAP2K1- and ARAF-mutant histiocytoses had clinical responses to MEK inhibition and sorafenib, respectively, highlighting the importance of comprehensive genomic analysis of these disorders.

This has led to an increasing number of commercial kits optimised for the purification of circulating free (cf) DNA and RNA/miRNA from biofluids such as plasma, serum and urine. To optimise and standardise current practices we sought to evaluate the performance of spin column-based and magnetic bead-based commercial kits. The following commercial cfDNA purification kits were analysed in this study: QIAamp circulating nucleic acid kit (Qiagen, Germany); Plasma/serum cell-free circulating DNA Purification midi kit (Norgen Biotek, Canada); QIAamp minElute ccfDNA mini kit (Qiagen); Maxwell RSC ccfDNA plasma kit (Promega, USA); MagMAX cell-free DNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems, USA); and NextPrep-Mag cfDNA isolation kit (Bioo Scientific, USA). Extracted DNA from the plasma of healthy individuals, either nonspiked or spiked with DNA fragments or cfDNA, was evaluated for recovery using either a BioRad Experion or ddPCR analysis. This study represents the first to use a comprehensive size distribution of spiked-in DNA fragments to evaluate commercial cfDNA kits. The commonly used spin column-based Qiagen QIAamp circulating nucleic acid kit was found to be the most consistent performing kit across the two evaluation assays employed. The Qiagen QIAamp minElute ccfDNA mini kit represented the best performing magnetic bead-based kit and provides an alternative based on lower cost/sample with a simpler workflow than spin column-based kits.},

There was very little agreement between veterinary practices as to whether bitches should be allowed to have their first season before neutering, with 164 of 973 respondents (16.9 per cent) always recommending this, 198 (20.3 per cent) recommending it most of the time, 203 (20.9 per cent) sometimes, 203 (20.9 per cent) rarely and 201 (20.6 per cent) never recommending it. The owner study showed that 54 per cent of dogs (233 of 431) were neutered, with the North region having the lowest proportion of neutered dogs (11 of 25; 44.0 per cent).},

Of the lesions initially treated at the Mayo Clinic, 95\% were typical ABC; the rest were ,,solid''︁ variants. Except for the absence of obvious cavernous channels and spaces, there was no significant histologic difference between solid variant and typical ABC. Radio-graphically, ABC is an eccentric expansile lesion commonly located at the metaphysis of long bones. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging may show multiple internal septations or fluid levels. In the 153 patients treated, 19\% had recurrence after curettage (intralesional excision). Recurrence was most common during the first 2 postoperative years.},

Although the aetiology of most cancers is likely to be multifactorial, the limited genetic diversity seen in purebred dogs facilitates genetic linkage or association studies on relatively small populations as compared to humans, and by using newly developed resources, genome-wide association studies in dog breeds are proving to be a powerful tool for unravelling complex disorders. This paper will review the literature on canine breed susceptibility to histiocytic sarcoma, osteosarcoma, haemangiosarcoma, mast cell tumours, lymphoma, melanoma, and mammary tumours including the recent advances in knowledge through molecular genetic, cytogenetic, and genome wide association studies.},

Two dogs were lost to follow-up and 72 dogs (42\%) died from confirmed neoplasia. Twenty dogs (11.6\%) died of unconfirmed tumours and 61 (35\%) died from non-neoplastic conditions. The cause of death was unknown for 19 dogs. Soft tissue sarcoma (especially histiocytic sarcoma) was the predominant cancer type, affecting 32 dogs (44\% of neoplasms). Six dogs died with malignant melanoma and three with lymphoma. Median age at death was 9 years for dogs with tumours (eight for sarcoma patients) and 12 years for non-neoplastic fatalities. The results confirm that soft tissue sarcoma, particularly histiocytic sarcoma, is a major cause of mortality in this breed. \textcopyright{} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {The malignant neoplasm cases reported from Alameda County, California, during 3 years, to a central animal neoplasm registry, were analyzed to provide estimates of cancer incidence in dogs and cats, and to measure the effects of age, sex, and breed on cancer development in these species. The estimated annual incidence rates for cancer of all sites were 381.2 per 100,000 dogs and 155.8 per 100,000 cats. The annual incidence rate for all cancer in Alameda County human residents was exceeded by the comparable canine rate, and both canine and human rates were over twice the feline rate. The Mantel-Haenszel procedure was used for testing possible associations between sex and breed characteristics and cancer of specific sites. Male dogs had greater relative risk of developing cancer of the mouth and pharynx than female dogs. Male cats had greater risk of lymphosarcoma than females. Neutering had a significant sparing effect on mammary cancer development; both intact female dogs and cats had approximately sevenfold greater risk of developing mammary cancer than neutered of the same species. Purebred dogs were significantly over-represented among cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma and mammary cancer. The boxer breed had a significantly higher risk than other purebred dogs of developing malignant melanoma of the skin, other skin malignancies, and cancer of connective tissue. German shepherd dogs had a greater risk of developing oral and pharyngeal cancer. Chihuahua dogs and Siamese cats were significantly underrepresented among skin cancer cases (melanomas excluded). Animal cancer models for studying breast cancer in women, genetic effects upon carcinogenesis, and human leukemia are discussed. Future studies of animal cancer should provide comparable morbidity information in other areas to permit identification of geographic differences and clues to the etiology of neoplasia.},

  abstract = {ObjectiveTo determine the efficacy of percutaneous sclerotherapy in the treatment of aneurysmal bone cysts.Materials and methodsSeventeen patients (7 girls, 10 boys) with aneurysmal bone cysts were treated by the percutaneous approach with Ethibloc (n=14) and histoacryl glue (n=3) in our institution between January 1994 and June 2000. The cysts were located in the extremities (n=6), pelvis (n=2), spine (n=2), mandible (n=5), rib (n=1) and sphenoid bone (n=1). Percutaneous sclerotherapy was performed with fluoroscopic and/or computed tomographic guidance under general anesthesia. Clinical and imaging follow-up lasted from 24 months to 9 years and 6 months (mean: 57.3 months). The results were quantified as: excellent (residual cyst less than 20\% of the initial involvement), satisfactory (residual cyst 30\textendash 50\%), unsatisfactory (residual cyst more than 50\%).ResultsThe age of the patients ranged from 4 years and 6 months to 15 years and 8 months (mean: 11 years and 2 months). In nine patients, the therapeutic procedure was repeated 2\textendash 5 times. Excellent regression was observed in 16 (94\%), satisfactory results in 1 (6\%). There was no failure (unsatisfactory result or no response to treatment) in this reported series. The complications were minor and included: local inflammatory reaction (n=2), small blister (n=1), and leakage (n=1). Relief of symptoms was achieved in all patients. No recurrence was noted during follow-up.ConclusionPercutaneous sclerotherapy of aneurysmal bone cysts with Ethibloc is safe and effective. It is an important alternative to surgery, especially when surgery is technically impossible or not recommended in high-risk patients.},

It has been known for many years that FA patient-derived cells are exquisitely sensitive to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents such as cisplatin and mitomycin C. On this basis, it was widely assumed that failure to repair endogenous interstrand cross-links (ICLs) causes FA, although the endogenous mutagen that generates these lesions remained elusive. Recent genetic evidence now suggests that endogenous aldehydes are the driving force behind FA. Importantly, aldehydes cause a variety of DNA lesions, including ICLs and DNA protein cross-links (DPCs), re-kindling the debate about which DNA lesions cause FA. In this review, we discuss new developments in our understanding of DPC and ICL repair, and how these findings bear on the question of which DNA lesion underlies FA.},

However, this is hindered due to lack reliable diagnostic and predictive markers which mean that the majority of patients succumb to their condition within a few months. We present a pilot study of the detection circulating free DNA (cfDNA) combined with tumor specific mutation detection by digital PCR as a novel minimally invasive biomarker in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This was compared to the detection of CTC by the CellSearch\textregistered{} system and a novel CTC enrichment strategy based on CD45 positive cell depletion. The aim of the study was to assess tumor specific DNA detection in plasma and CTC detection as prognostic markers in PDAC. We detected KRAS mutant cfDNA in 26~\% of patients of all stages and this correlated strongly with Overall Survival (OS), 60~days (95~\% CI: 19\textendash 317) for KRAS mutation positive vs 772~days for KRAS mutation negative (95~\% CI: 416\textendash 1127). Although, the presence of CTC detected by the CellSearch\textregistered{} system did correlate significantly with OS, 88~days (95~\% CI: 27\textendash 206) CTC positive vs 393~days CTC negative (95~\% CI: 284\textendash 501), CTC were detected in only 20~\% of patients, the majority of which had metastatic disease, whereas KRAS mutant cfDNA was detected in patients with both resectable and advanced disease. Tumor specific cfDNA detection and CTC detection are promising markers for the management of patients with PDAC, although there is a need to validate these results in a larger patient cohort and optimize the detection of CTC in PDAC by applying the appropriate markers for their detection.},

The lack of consistency between the various protocols for sample handling and the techniques used for ccfDNA analysis is one of the major obstacles in translating ccfDNA analysis to clinical practice. Although this point is highlighted regularly in the published reviews on ccfDNA analysis, no standard operating procedure currently exists despite several ongoing clinical studies on ccfDNA analysis.This review examines the preanalytical parameters potentially affecting ccfDNA concentration and fragmentation at each preanalytical step from blood drawing to the storage of ccfDNA extracts.Analysis of data in the literature and our own observations revealed the influence of preanalytical factors on ccfDNA analysis. Based on these data, we determined the optimal preanalytical protocols for ccfDNA analysis and ultimately, a guideline for the translation of ccfDNA analysis in routine clinical practice. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Since 1986 several authors have reported a high prevalence of tumours in both breeds, especially malignant histiocytosis/histiocytic sarcoma, which has a negative influence on life expectancy. However, many earlier reports included relatively low numbers of dogs, distributed over a small number of broad categories, often using outdated disease criteria. The aim of this study was to provide new data on causes of death, and the relative role of tumours, especially histiocytic sarcoma, collected and verified in a large number of dogs of both breeds in co-operation with dog owners and veterinarians.The study demonstrates that the death of at least 55.1\% of Bernese mountain dogs and 63.8\% of Flat-coated retrievers is associated with malignant tumours. In addition, it appears that over 1/7 of all Bernese mountain dogs and Flat-coated retrievers die because of histiocytic sarcoma. This emphasises the need for further research on tumours, especially histiocytic sarcoma. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The differential diagnosis for HS is broad, encompassing round cell tumors, sarcomas and other histiocytic diseases. The aim of this study was to establish morphological and immunohistochemical criteria for routine use on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples and cytological smears for the recognition and differentiation of canine HS and its subtypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospectively, tumor sections were reviewed from 449 BMD and 380 FCR with confirmed or suspected HS, other histiocytic conditions, or a disease of the differential diagnosis of HS. RESULTS In a large proportion of cases, 47.5\% for histology and for 46.3\% cytology, the initial diagnosis was changed after the revision process. A large variation in morphological features of HS was observed in this study, making the existence of several subtypes in dogs also very likely. Furthermore, the different percentage of morphological features between BMD and FCR indicates the different mixture of cell type origins resulting possibly from genetic or environmental differences at the onset of HS in those breeds. CONCLUSION This study stresses the value of a strictly applied and standardized scoring system for microscopic evaluation of tumor sections and smears, and the implementation of review and revision of pathological diagnoses.},

  abstract = {Historically, feline mediastinal lymphoma has been associated with young age, positive feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) status, Siamese breed and short survival times. Recent studies following widespread FeLV vaccination in the UK are lacking. The aim of this retrospective multi-institutional study was to re-evaluate the signalment, retroviral status, response to chemotherapy, survival and prognostic indicators in feline mediastinal lymphoma cases in the post-vaccination era. Records of cats with clinical signs associated with a mediastinal mass and cytologically/histologically confirmed lymphoma were reviewed from five UK referral centres (1998\textendash 2010). Treatment response, survival and prognostic indicators were assessed in treated cats with follow-up data. Fifty-five cases were reviewed. The median age was 3 years (range, 0.5\textendash 12 years); 12 cats (21.8\%) were Siamese; and the male to female ratio was 3.2:1.0. Five cats were FeLV-positive and two were feline immunodeficiency-positive. Chemotherapy response and survival was evaluated in 38 cats. Overall response was 94.7\%; complete (CR) and partial response (PR) rates did not differ significantly between protocols: COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone) (n = 26, CR 61.5\%, PR 34.0\%); Madison\textendash Wisconsin (MW) (n = 12, CR 66.7\%, PR 25.0\%). Overall median survival was 373 days (range, 20\textendash 2015 days) (COP 484 days [range, 20\textendash 980 days]; MW 211 days [range, 24\textendash 2015 days] [P = 0.892]). Cats achieving CR survived longer (980 days vs 42 days for PR; P = 0.032). Age, breed, sex, location (mediastinal vs mediastinal plus other sites), retroviral status and glucocorticoid pretreatment did not affect response or survival. Feline mediastinal lymphoma cases frequently responded to chemotherapy with durable survival times, particularly in cats achieving CR. The prevalence of FeLV-antigenaemic cats was low; males and young Siamese cats appeared to be over-represented.},

  abstract = {Historically, feline mediastinal lymphoma has been associated with young age, positive feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) status, Siamese breed and short survival times. Recent studies following widespread FeLV vaccination in the UK are lacking. The aim of this retrospective multi-institutional study was to re-evaluate the signalment, retroviral status, response to chemotherapy, survival and prognostic indicators in feline mediastinal lymphoma cases in the post-vaccination era. Records of cats with clinical signs associated with a mediastinal mass and cytologically/histologically confirmed lymphoma were reviewed from five UK referral centres (1998\textendash 2010). Treatment response, survival and prognostic indicators were assessed in treated cats with follow-up data. Fifty-five cases were reviewed. The median age was 3 years (range, 0.5\textendash 12 years); 12 cats (21.8\%) were Siamese; and the male to female ratio was 3.2:1.0. Five cats were FeLV-positive and two were feline immunodeficiency-positive. Chemotherapy response and survival was evaluated in 38 cats. Overall response was 94.7\%; complete (CR) and partial response (PR) rates did not differ significantly between protocols: COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone) (n = 26, CR 61.5\%, PR 34.0\%); Madison\textendash Wisconsin (MW) (n = 12, CR 66.7\%, PR 25.0\%). Overall median survival was 373 days (range, 20\textendash 2015 days) (COP 484 days [range, 20\textendash 980 days]; MW 211 days [range, 24\textendash 2015 days] [P = 0.892]). Cats achieving CR survived longer (980 days vs 42 days for PR; P = 0.032). Age, breed, sex, location (mediastinal vs mediastinal plus other sites), retroviral status and glucocorticoid pretreatment did not affect response or survival. Feline mediastinal lymphoma cases frequently responded to chemotherapy with durable survival times, particularly in cats achieving CR. The prevalence of FeLV-antigenaemic cats was low; males and young Siamese cats appeared to be over-represented.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer affecting men, it accounts for 29\% of all male cancer and 11\% of all male cancer related death. DNA is normally released from an apoptotic source which generates small fragments of cell-free DNA, whereas cancer patients have cell-free circulating DNA that originated from necrosis, autophagy, or mitotic catastrophe, which produce large fragments. AIM OF WORK Differentiate the cell free DNA levels (cfDNA) and its integrity in prostate cancer patients and control group composed of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and healthy persons. METHODOLOGY cf-DNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR amplification in prostate cancer patients (n\,=\,50), (BPH) benign prostate hyperplasia (n\,=\,25) and healthy controls (n\,=\,30) using two sets of ALU gene (product size of 115bp and 247-bp) and its integrity was calculated as a ratio of qPCR results of 247bp ALU over 115bp ALU. RESULTS Highly significant levels of cf-DNA and its integrity in PC patients compared to BPH. Twenty-eight (56\%) patients with prostate cancer had bone metastasis. ALU115 qpcr is superior to the other markers in discriminating metastatic patients with a sensitivity of 96.4\% and a specificity of 86.4\% and (AUC=0.981) CONCLUSION ALU115 qpcr could be used as a valuable biomarker helping in identifying high risk patients, indicating early spread of tumor cells as a potential seed for future metastases.},

  abstract = {Thirty-seven cases of histiocytic-like sarcomas (HLSs) in flat-coated retriever dogs were evaluated retrospectively. This tumour accounted for 36\% of the malignant tumours seen in this breed during the study period. The median age at presentation was 8.2 years. Thirty-four dogs presented with a swelling or mass in a muscle group or surrounding a joint. The remaining three presented for rib (1), cutaneous (1) or primary splenic origin (1). A high rate of metastasis to local lymph nodes (45\%), thorax (20\%) and abdominal organs (20\% confirmed) was seen. Overall metastastic rate by the time of death was 70\%. The median survival for all dogs was 123 days. The most significant prognostic indicator was presence of distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis with median survival of 68 or 200 days, with or without metastasis, respectively. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy significantly improved survival. Dogs given chemotherapy survived a median of 185 versus 34 days for dogs that were not (P = 0.0008). Dogs treated with radiation survived a median of 182 versus 60 days for those that were not (P = 0.0282). Dogs receiving only palliative therapy survived a median of 17 versus 167 days in dogs receiving any kind of radiation, chemotherapy, surgery or combinations. A set protocol of radiation and CCNU (RTCCNU) induced minimal toxicity and provided a median survival of 208 versus 68 days for all other dogs. While this tumour carries a poor long-term prognosis in flat-coated retrievers, it is reasonable to treat these dogs for palliation of signs and extension of life.},

To date, at least 12 purebred dog breeds have been found to be affected by this mutation. The aim of this study was to update information about the prevalence of ABCB1 mutation (c.227\_230delATAG) in predisposed breeds in multiple European countries. This large scale survey also includes countries which were not involved in previous studies. The samples were collected in the period from 2012 to 2014. The overview is based on genotyping data of 4729 individuals. The observed mutant allele frequencies were 58.5\% (Smooth Collie), 48.3\% (Rough Col-lie), 35\% (Australian Shepherd), 30.3\% (Shetland Sheepdog), 28.1\% (Silken Windhound), 26.1\% (Miniature Australian Shepherd), 24.3\% (Longhaired Whippet), 16.2\% (White Swiss Shepherd) and 0\% (Border Collie). The possible presence of an ABCB1 mutant allele in Akita-Inu breed has been investigated with negative results. This information could be helpful for breeders in optimization of their breeding strategy and for veterinarians when prescribing drug therapy for dogs of predisposed breeds.},

  abstract = {Identifying loci under natural selection from genomic surveys is of great interest in different research areas. Commonly used methods to separate neutral effects from adaptive effects are based on locus-specific population differentiation coefficients to identify outliers. Here we extend such an approach to estimate directly the probability that each locus is subject to selection using a Bayesian method. We also extend it to allow the use of dominant markers like AFLPs. It has been shown that this model is robust to complex demographic scenarios for neutral genetic differentiation. Here we show that the inclusion of isolated populations that underwent a strong bottleneck can lead to a high rate of false positives. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to avoid them by carefully choosing the populations that should be included in the analysis. We analyze two previously published data sets: a human data set of codominant markers and a Littorina saxatilis data set of dominant markers. We also perform a detailed sensitivity study to compare the power of the method using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), SNP, and microsatellite markers. The method has been implemented in a new software available at our website (http://www-leca.ujf-grenoble.fr/logiciels.htm).},

To this end, we generated a novel antibody to canine NCR1 (NKp46), the putative species-wide marker of NK cells, enabling purification of NK cells for further characterization. We demonstrate that CD3-/NKp46+ cells in healthy and osteosarcoma-bearing canines have phenotypic similarity to human CD3-/NKp46+ NK cells, expressing mRNA for CD16 and the natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp30, NKp44, and NKp80. Functionally, we demonstrate with the calcein release assay that canine CD3-/NKp46+ cells kill canine tumor cell lines without prior sensitization and secrete IFN-{$\gamma$}, TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-8, IL-10, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor as measured by Luminex. Similar to human NK cells, CD3-/NKp46+ cells expand rapidly on feeder cells expressing 4-1BBL and membrane-bound IL-21 (median\,=\,20,283-fold in 21\,days). Furthermore, we identify a minor Null population (CD3-/CD21-/CD14-/NKp46-) with reduced cytotoxicity against osteosarcoma cells, but similar cytokine secretion as CD3-/NKp46+ cells.

  abstract = {Background and objective~ Testosterone (T) treatment has recently been shown to induce an increase in the number of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) through a possible effect on bone marrow. Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadal (HH) men have low circulating EPCs that increase significantly after T treatment. Moreover, expression of the androgen receptor (AR) has been demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in these cells, suggesting that T might also have a direct effect on EPC function. In the present study we investigated the expression and function of the AR in human EPCs and the in~vitro effect of androgens on EPC function. Design and patients~ EPCs obtained from healthy male anonymous blood donors were analysed after androgen stimulation with and without AR antagonist administration (flutamide). Results~ Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated the expression of AR mRNA and protein in human EPCs. Stimulation of these cells with the synthetic androgen methyltrienolone (R1881) caused AR translocation in the nucleus, suggesting its activation. Colony forming unit (CFU), proliferation and migration assays under different doses of R1881 demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in EPC proliferation, migration and colony formation. All these effects are abolished by flutamide pretreatment. Conclusions~ This study showed that the increase in the proliferation, migration and colony formation activity of EPCs induced by androgens is an AR-mediated pathway.

  abstract = {Background and objective~ Testosterone (T) treatment has recently been shown to induce an increase in the number of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) through a possible effect on bone marrow. Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadal (HH) men have low circulating EPCs that increase significantly after T treatment. Moreover, expression of the androgen receptor (AR) has been demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in these cells, suggesting that T might also have a direct effect on EPC function. In the present study we investigated the expression and function of the AR in human EPCs and the in~vitro effect of androgens on EPC function. Design and patients~ EPCs obtained from healthy male anonymous blood donors were analysed after androgen stimulation with and without AR antagonist administration (flutamide). Results~ Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated the expression of AR mRNA and protein in human EPCs. Stimulation of these cells with the synthetic androgen methyltrienolone (R1881) caused AR translocation in the nucleus, suggesting its activation.

Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the levels of circulating PCs and EPCs in men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and the effect of prolonged testosterone (T) replacement therapy on these cells. Design and Setting: We conducted a prospective study on males with HH at a university andrological center. Patients: The study included 10 young HH patients (28.6 {$\pm$} 3.1 yr) and 25 age-matched controls. Interventions: Idiopathic HH patients were treated with T gel therapy, 50 mg/d for 6 months. Main Outcome Measures: We assessed circulating PC and EPC concentrations and immunocytochemistry for androgen receptor expression on cultured EPCs. Results: At baseline, HH patients showed a significant reduction of both PCs and EPCs with respect to controls. T replacement therapy induced a significant increase of these cells with respect to baseline. Immunocytochemistry on cultured EPCs showed strong expression of the androgen receptor. Conclusions: Hypotestosteronemia is associated with a low number of circulating PCs and EPCs in young HH subjects. T treatment is able to induce an increase in these cells through a possible direct effect on the bone marrow.},

Between 1 and 6 months after orchidectomy, the value of serum testosterone decreased (1 month), while the levels of parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, total calcium, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase activity increased significantly, indicating a high bone turnover.

  abstract = {Objective To determine patients' characteristics and anatomical distribution of lesions in cats with lymphosarcoma. Design Prospective multi-institutional study of naturally occurring feline lymphosarcoma. Methods Veterinarians in Sydney were provided with free diagnostic laboratory services for suspect cases of feline lym-phosarcoma. Lymphosarcoma was diagnosed based on physical findings, radiographic and/or ultrasonographic images and results of cytological or histopathological examination. When owners were not interested in pursuing an antemortem diagnosis, suspect cases were collected for necropsy. Patients' characteristics and physical findings were recorded. A modified scheme for anatomical classification of lesions was devised including a `mixed' category for cases which involved two or more anatomical forms. Results One hundred and eighteen cases were accrued over an 18 month period. The median age was 120 months and range 5 to 212 months. Age distribution was bimodal, with a small peak for cats less than 24 months, and a normal distribution centred on 97 to 120 months. Eighty cats were domestic crossbreds, 22 were Siamese or Oriental cats (including crosses), 6 were Burmese, 5 were purebred longhairs and the remaining 5 were one of a number of purebred shorthaired breeds. In comparison to 1017 consecutive cases admitted to our hospital for conditions other than lymphosarcoma, Siamese/Oriental cats were over-represented amongst lymphosarcoma cases (P = 0.0006). Male cats were also over-represented, accounting for 72 of 118 cases (P = 0.05). Abdominal lymphosarcoma was the most common anatomical form (43 cats), followed by mixed (39), nodal (20), mediastinal (9) and atypical (involving non-lymphoid organs, 7) forms. When analysed for specific organ involvement, 29 (25\%) had mediastinal involvement, 71 (60\%) had abdominal involvement including 60 (51\%) with involvement of the intestinal tract and/or mesenteric lymph nodes and 36 (31\%) with bilateral renal involvement, and 47 (40\%) had peripheral lymph node involvement.

  abstract = {Objective To determine patients' characteristics and anatomical distribution of lesions in cats with lymphosarcoma. Design Prospective multi-institutional study of naturally occurring feline lymphosarcoma. Methods Veterinarians in Sydney were provided with free diagnostic laboratory services for suspect cases of feline lym-phosarcoma. Lymphosarcoma was diagnosed based on physical findings, radiographic and/or ultrasonographic images and results of cytological or histopathological examination. When owners were not interested in pursuing an antemortem diagnosis, suspect cases were collected for necropsy. Patients' characteristics and physical findings were recorded. A modified scheme for anatomical classification of lesions was devised including a `mixed' category for cases which involved two or more anatomical forms. Results One hundred and eighteen cases were accrued over an 18 month period. The median age was 120 months and range 5 to 212 months. Age distribution was bimodal, with a small peak for cats less than 24 months, and a normal distribution centred on 97 to 120 months. Eighty cats were domestic crossbreds, 22 were Siamese or Oriental cats (including crosses), 6 were Burmese, 5 were purebred longhairs and the remaining 5 were one of a number of purebred shorthaired breeds. In comparison to 1017 consecutive cases admitted to our hospital for conditions other than lymphosarcoma, Siamese/Oriental cats were over-represented amongst lymphosarcoma cases (P = 0.0006). Male cats were also over-represented, accounting for 72 of 118 cases (P = 0.05). Abdominal lymphosarcoma was the most common anatomical form (43 cats), followed by mixed (39), nodal (20), mediastinal (9) and atypical (involving non-lymphoid organs, 7) forms. When analysed for specific organ involvement, 29 (25\%) had mediastinal involvement, 71 (60\%) had abdominal involvement including 60 (51\%) with involvement of the intestinal tract and/or mesenteric lymph nodes and 36 (31\%) with bilateral renal involvement, and 47 (40\%) had peripheral lymph node involvement. No case of primary lymphoid leukaemia was identified. A noticeable subgroup of cats younger than 24 months had involvement of the anterior mediastinum with or without concurrent enlargement of cervical or axillary lymph nodes; Siamese/Oriental cats were over-represented in this subgroup.

  abstract = {Two problems can arise when working with small quantities of DNA in polypropylene tubes: first, significant amounts of DNA can become lost by sticking to the tube walls; second, short DNA fragments tend to denature when binding to polypropylene. In addition, DNA also tends to denature upon dehydration. We have found that a simple way to solve these problems is by using polyallomer tubes instead of polypropylene and by avoiding certain salts, such as sodium acetate, when drying DNA. DNA is usually stored in polypropylene tubes, which have become widely used for their resistance to solvents, their strength, their ease of use and their low price. Polypropylene is a very hydrophobic material, whereas DNA is a highly charged macromolecule, two characteristics that minimize the interactions of DNA with tube walls and tend to avoid the adsorption problems often found with other macromolecules, especially proteins. But DNA can, in fact, bind to polypropylene tubes. This is particularly striking at high ionic strength: (Fig. 1) shows that DNA fragments bind quickly to polypropylene tube walls in 2.5 M NaCl, with 75\% of the material adsorbed after 1 h and 90\% after 3 h in this experiment. Under such conditions, the amount of adsorbed DNA can be as high as 5 ng /mm 2 of tube wall. Tests performed at ionic conditions varying from TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) to TE plus 0.5 M NaCl, showed that DNA also sticks to tube walls at lower ionic strength, but with important variations between different batches of tubes. Tests were performed with 1 ng of radioactively labelled DNA per tube in 10 \textmu l. With some batches of tubes, the percentage of adsorption was always high (between 80\% and 95\%; such tubes actually had a binding capacity as high as {$>$}10 ng for a volume of 10 \textmu l). With other tube batches from the same manufacturer (Eppendorf) the percentage of adsorption varied apparently at random between 5\% to 95\%, all conditions being kept identical. Finally, other batches always presented little adsorption ({$<$}10\%) at low ionic strength. In all those tests, using single-stranded instead of double-stranded DNA made no significant difference.},

This mutation has been detected in more than 10 purebred dog breeds as well as in mixed breed dogs. To evaluate the breed distribution of this mutation in Germany, 7378 dogs were screened, including 6999 purebred and 379 mixed breed dogs. The study included dog breeds that show close genetic relationship or share breeding history with one of the predisposed breeds but in which the occurrence of the MDR1 mutation has not been reported. MDR1 allele of 59\%, 45\%, 30\%, 24\%, 22\%, 17\%, 14\%, 4\% and 1\%, respectively. Allelic frequencies of 8\% and 2\% were determined in herding breed mixes and unclassified mixed breeds, respectively. Because of its widespread breed distribution and occurrence in many mixed breed dogs, it is difficult for veterinarians and dog owners to recognise whether MDR1-related drug sensitivity is relevant for an individual animal. This study provides a comprehensive overview of all affected dog breeds and many dog breeds that are probably unaffected on the basis of \$15,000 worldwide MDR1 genotyping data.},

  abstract = {The presence of BRAF variant V595E, as well as an increased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in canine transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) are well-described in the literature. The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation between breed (terrier versus non-terrier dogs), histological grade, COX-2 expression, and BRAF mutation in canine TCC. Therefore, transmural TCC biopsies from 65 dogs (15 terriers, 50 non-terriers) were graded histologically into low- and high-grade. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the intensity of COX-2 expression was performed using an immunoreactive score (IRS). Exon 15 of chromosome 16 was examined for the BRAF variant c.1799T {$>$} A by TaqMan\textregistered{} SNP assay. TCC was low-grade in 20 cases (one terrier, 19 non-terriers) and high-grade in 45 cases (14 terriers, 31 non-terriers). Contrary to humans, histological grade was not significantly correlated to the intensity of COX-2 expression. BRAF mutation was detected in 11/15 (73\%) TCC of terriers and in 18/50 (36\%) TCC of non-terriers. Histological grade and BRAF mutation were not correlated significantly (p = 0.2912). Terriers had a considerably higher prevalence of high-grade tumors (p {$<$} 0.0001), as well as of BRAF mutation (p {$\leq$} 0.05) compared to non-terriers. In non-terriers, neoplasms with BRAF mutation showed a significantly higher intensity of COX-2 expression than those without BRAF mutation (p {$\leq$} 0.05). In conclusion, in contrast to humans, testing for BRAF mutation in canine TCC is a sensitive diagnostic method especially in terriers (73\%) and may be recommended as a screening test. However, evidence of BRAF mutation in canine TCC is not a predictor for the histological grade. Moreover, a positive correlation between histological grade and the intensity of COX-2 expression was not found. Further studies are necessary to clarify the clinical and prognostic relevance of the elevated intensity of COX-2 expression of TCC with BRAF mutation detected in non-terriers.},

  abstract = {The discovery of a man with a homozygous mutation in the estrogen receptor alpha gene, which results in estrogen-receptor alpha resistance, and of males and females with autosomal recessive mutations in the CYP19 gene encoding aromatase, which leads to a failure to synthesize estrogens, has challenged conventional wisdom about the 'unimportant' role of estrogen in the male. For example, in the male, estrogen (not androgen) derived from direct testicular secretion (approximately 20\%) and from extragonadal aromatization of testosterone and androstenedione (approximately 80\%), is the critical sex hormone in the pubertal growth spurt, skeletal maturation, accrual of peak bone mass, and the maintenance of bone mass in the adult. Estrogen stimulates chondrogenesis in the epiphyseal growth plate increasing pubertal linear growth. At puberty, estrogen promotes skeletal maturation and the gradual, progressive closure of the epiphyseal growth plate, possibly as a consequence of both estrogen-induced vascular and osteoblastic invasion and the termination of chondrogenesis. In addition, during puberty and into the third decade, estrogen has an anabolic effect on the osteoblast and an apoptotic effect on the osteoclast, increasing bone mineral acquisition in axial and appendicular bone. In the adult, estrogen is important in maintaining the constancy of bone mass through its effects on remodeling and bone turnover. Establishing a role for estrogen does not exclude a direct action of testosterone on bone in the human male (especially on cortical bone), but this action is less characterized than thought in the past and is relatively minor in comparison with the major effect of estrogen in the male.},

  abstract = {The discovery of a man with a homozygous mutation in the estrogen receptor alpha gene, which results in estrogen-receptor alpha resistance, and of males and females with autosomal recessive mutations in the CYP19 gene encoding aromatase, which leads to a failure to synthesize estrogens, has challenged conventional wisdom about the 'unimportant' role of estrogen in the male. For example, in the male, estrogen (not androgen) derived from direct testicular secretion (approximately 20\%) and from extragonadal aromatization of testosterone and androstenedione (approximately 80\%), is the critical sex hormone in the pubertal growth spurt, skeletal maturation, accrual of peak bone mass, and the maintenance of bone mass in the adult. Estrogen stimulates chondrogenesis in the epiphyseal growth plate increasing pubertal linear growth. At puberty, estrogen promotes skeletal maturation and the gradual, progressive closure of the epiphyseal growth plate, possibly as a consequence of both estrogen-induced vascular and osteoblastic invasion and the termination of chondrogenesis. In addition, during puberty and into the third decade, estrogen has an anabolic effect on the osteoblast and an apoptotic effect on the osteoclast, increasing bone mineral acquisition in axial and appendicular bone. In the adult, estrogen is important in maintaining the constancy of bone mass through its effects on remodeling and bone turnover. Establishing a role for estrogen does not exclude a direct action of testosterone on bone in the human male (especially on cortical bone), but this action is less characterized than thought in the past and is relatively minor in comparison with the major effect of estrogen in the male.},

  abstract = {The distribution of genetic variation among populations is conveniently measured by Wright's FST, which is a scaled variance taking on values in [0,1]. For certain types of genetic markers and for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in particular, it is reasonable to presume that allelic differences at most loci are selectively neutral. For such loci, the distribution of genetic variation among populations is determined by the size of local populations, the pattern and rate of migration among those populations, and the rate of mutation. Because the demographic parameters (population sizes and migration rates) are common across all autosomal loci, locus-specific estimates of FST will depart from a common distribution only for loci with unusually high or low rates of mutation or for loci that are closely associated with genomic regions having a relationship with fitness. Thus, loci that are statistical outliers showing significantly more among-population differentiation than others may mark genomic regions subject to diversifying selection among the sample populations. Similarly, statistical outliers showing significantly less differentiation among populations than others may mark genomic regions subject to stabilizing selection across the sample populations. We propose several Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate locus-specific effects on FST, and we apply these models to single nucleotide polymorphism data from the HapMap project. Because loci that are physically associated with one another are likely to show similar patterns of variation, we introduce conditional autoregressive models to incorporate the local correlation among loci for high-resolution genomic data. We estimate the posterior distributions of model parameters using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Model comparison using several criteria, including deviance information criterion (DIC) and pseudomarginal likelihood (LPML), reveals that a model with locus- and population-specific effects is superior to other models for the data used in the analysis. To detect statistical outliers we propose an approach that measures divergence between the posterior distributions of locus-specific effects and the common FST with the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. We calibrate this measure by comparing values with those produced from the divergence between a biased and a fair coin.We conduct a simulation study to illustrate the performance of our approach for detecting loci subject to stabilizing/divergent selection, and we apply the proposed models to low- and high-resolution SNP data from the HapMap project. Model comparison using DIC and LPML reveals that conditional autoregressive (CAR) models are superior to alternative models for the high-resolution data. For both low- and high- resolution data, we identify statistical outliers that are associatedwith known genes. \textcopyright{} 2009 American Statistical Association.},

  abstract = {Objective: To establish a predictive method using whole genome genotyping for early intervention in canine hip dysplasia (CHD) risk management, for the prevention of the progression of secondary osteoarthritis (OA), and for selective breeding. Design: Two sets of dogs (six breeds) were genotyped with dense SNPs covering the entire canine genome. The first set contained 359 dogs upon which a predictive formula for genomic breeding value (GBV) was derived by using their estimated breeding value (EBV) of the Norberg angle (a measure of CHD) and their genotypes. To investigate how well the formula would work for an individual dog with genotype only (without using EBV), a cross validation was performed by masking the EBV of one dog at a time. The genomic data and the EBV of the remaining dogs were used to predict the GBV for the single dog that was left out. The second set of dogs included 38 new Labrador retriever dogs, which had no pedigree relationship to the dogs in the first set. Results: The cross validation showed a strong correlation (R{$>$} 0.7) between the EBV and the GBV. The independent validation showed a moderate correlation (R= 0.5) between GBV for the Norberg angle and the observed Norberg angle (no EBV was available for the new 38 dogs). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the genomic data were all above 70\%. Conclusions: Prediction of CHD from genomic data is feasible, and can be applied for risk management of CHD and early selection for genetic improvement to reduce the prevalence of CHD in breeding programs. The prediction can be implemented before maturity, at which age current radiographic screening programs are traditionally applied, and as soon as DNA is available. \textcopyright{} 2010 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.},

  abstract = {Objective Pain is one of the few drawbacks of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) in patients with nodular thyroid disease (NTD). Lidocaine/prilocaine cream, an eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics (EMLA), is a frequently used topical anaesthetic. Despite its well-documented efficacy for the relief of pain associated with other cutaneous procedures that involve needle insertion, the analgesic role of EMLA has not been previously reported in patients with NTD who are undergoing FNAB. The aim of this study was to determine the analgesic efficacy of EMLA for FNAB-associated pain in patients with NTD. Design Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients The study was conducted at a thyroid outpatient clinic. We studied 99 patients with NTD. Measurements Patients with NTD were allocated to receive either 2{$\cdot$}5 g of EMLA (n = 50) or placebo (n = 49) 60 min before ultrasonographically guided FNAB. A series of four biopsies of each nodule was performed. Patients rated pain associated with the procedure according to a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS), an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS), and 4-category verbal rating scale (VRS). Results When the EMLA group was compared with the placebo group, there were no significant differences with respect to age, sex, thyroid volume, nodule size or nodule site. Significant differences were noted in the pain ratings of the two groups according to all three pain scales. When the effectiveness of EMLA was compared with that of placebo, the mean VAS score was 25{$\cdot$}0 {$\pm$} 22{$\cdot$}3 mm vs. 40{$\cdot$}0 {$\pm$} 30{$\cdot$}5 mm (P = 0{$\cdot$}006) and the mean NRS score was 2{$\cdot$}9 {$\pm$} 2{$\cdot$}3 points vs. 4{$\cdot$}0 {$\pm$} 2{$\cdot$}6 points (P = 0{$\cdot$}02). The absolute numbers according to VRS score in each group was also significantly different (P = 0{$\cdot$}01). Although our sample size was small, the data suggest that FNAB-associated pain was sex-related and that women were significantly more sensitive than were men (P = 0{$\cdot$}003 for VAS score and P = 0{$\cdot$}001 for NRS score). No adverse effects from the use of EMLA were reported. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that a topical anaesthetic, EMLA, provides an effective and noninvasive analgesia during the FNAB of NTD.},

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of a needle-free injection of lidocaine in achieving satisfactory pain control in patients undergoing FNAB of thyroid nodules. Design: Patients were allocated to receive either lidocaine administered by needle-free injection system (n = 55) or placebo (isotonic saline) (n = 52) 2\textendash 3 minutes before FNAB.

Main outcome measure: The two groups studied were similar with respect to age, sex, thyroid volume, nodule size, and nodule site.

Flow cytometric analysis identified a neoplastic lymphoid population in 12 of the 13 cats of group 1, confirming the diagnosis of lymphoma and further characterizing it. The six cats in group 2 showed a mixed lymphoid population, which was not suggestive of a neoplastic disorder. Flow cytometry is a valuable and powerful tool for refining the diagnosis of feline lymphoproliferative disorders.},

Veterinary hospital records were examined over a 13-year period for the effects of neutering during specified age ranges: before 6 mo., and during 6\textendash 11 mo., year 1 or years 2 through 8. The joint disorders examined were hip dysplasia, cranial cruciate ligament tear and elbow dysplasia. The cancers examined were lymphosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, mast cell tumor, and mammary cancer. The results for the Golden Retriever were similar to the previous study, but there were notable differences between breeds. In Labrador Retrievers, where about 5 percent of gonadally intact males and females had one or more joint disorders, neutering at \&lt;6 mo. doubled the incidence of one or more joint disorders in both sexes. In male and female Golden Retrievers, with the same 5 percent rate of joint disorders in intact dogs, neutering at \&lt;6 mo. increased the incidence of a joint disorder to 4\textendash 5 times that of intact dogs. The incidence of one or more cancers in female Labrador Retrievers increased slightly above the 3 percent level of intact females with neutering. In contrast, in female Golden Retrievers, with the same 3 percent rate of one or more cancers in intact females, neutering at all periods through 8 years of age increased the rate of at least one of the cancers by 3\textendash 4 times. In male Golden and Labrador Retrievers neutering had relatively minor effects in increasing the occurrence of cancers. Comparisons of cancers in the two breeds suggest that the occurrence of cancers in female Golden Retrievers is a reflection of particular vulnerability to gonadal hormone removal.},

The compartment is lined on its marrow side by flattened cells and on its osseous side by the remodeling bone surface, resembling a roof of flattened cells covering the bone surface. The flat marrow lining cells are in continuity with the bone lining cells at the margins of the BRC. We examined a large number of diagnostic bone biopsy specimens received during recent years in the department. Furthermore, 10 patients (8 women and 2 men, median age 56 [40\textendash 69] years) with the high turnover disease of primary hyperparathyroidism who were treated with parathyroidectomy and followed for 3 years were included in the histomorphometric study. Bone samples for the immuno-enzyme staining were obtained from an amputated extremity of child. The total cancellous bone surface covered by BRC decreases by 50\% (p {$<$} 0.05) following normalization of turnover and is paralleled by a similar 50\% decrease in remodeling surface (p {$<$} 0.05). The entire eroded surface and two-thirds of the osteoid surface are covered by a BRC. BRC-covered uncompleted walls are 30\% (p {$<$} 0.05) thinner than those without a BRC. This indicates that the BRC is invariably associated with the early phases of bone remodeling, that is, bone resorption, whereas it closes during the late part of bone formation. Immuno-enzyme staining shows that the flat marrow lining cells are positive for alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and osteonectin, suggesting that they are bone cells. The first step in cancellous bone remodeling is thought to be the lining cells digesting the unmineralized matrix membrane followed by their disappearance and the arrival of the bone multicellular unit (BMU). We suggest that the lining cell barrier persists during bone remodeling; that the old lining cells become the marrow lining cells, allowing bone resorption and bone formation to proceed under a common roof of lining cells; that, at the end of bone formation, new bone lining cells derived from the flattened osteoblasts replace the marrow lining cells thereby closing the BRC; and that the two layers of lining cells eventually becomes a single layer. The integrity of the osteocyte-lining cell system is reestablished by the new generation of lining cells. The BRC most likely serves multiple purposes, including efficient exchange of matrix constituents and minerals, routing, monitoring, or modulating bone cell recruitment, and possibly the anatomical basis for the coupling of bone remodeling.},

Sharing high clinical and histopathological similarities with human HS, the canine HS is conversely frequent in specific breeds and thus constitutes a unique spontaneous model for human HS to decipher the genetic bases and to explore therapeutic options. We identified sequence alterations in the MAPK pathway in at least 63.9\% (71/111) of HS cases with mutually exclusive BRAF (0.9\%; 1/111), KRAS (7.2\%; 8/111) and PTPN11 (56.75\%; 63/111) mutations concentrated at hotspots common to human cancers. Recurrent PTPN11 mutations are associated to visceral disseminated HS subtype in dogs, the most aggressive clinical presentation. We then identified PTPN11 mutations in 3/19 (15.7\%) human HS patients. Thus, we propose PTPN11 mutations as key events for a specific subset of human and canine HS: the visceral disseminated form. Finally, by testing drugs targeting the MAPK pathway in eight canine HS cell lines, we identified a better anti-proliferation activity of MEK inhibitors than PTPN11 inhibitors in canine HS neoplastic cells. In combination, these results illustrate the relevance of naturally affected dogs in deciphering genetic mechanisms and selecting efficient targeted therapies for such rare and aggressive cancers in humans.},

Abstract (limite 300 words) Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is a rare but aggressive cancer in humans and dogs. The spontaneous canine model, with the clinical, epidemiological and histological similarities with human HS and specific breed predispositions, is a unique model/opportunity to unravel the genetic bases of this cancer. In this study, we aimed to identify germline risk factors associated with the development of HS in canine predisposed breeds. We used a methodology that combined several genome-wide association studies in a multi-breed and multi-cancer approach, as well as targeted next generation sequencing, and imputation combining several breeds (Bernese mountain dog, Rottweiler, flat coated retriever and golden retriever) and three haematopoietic cancers (HS, lymphoma and mast cell tumor). Results showed that we not only refined the previously identified HS risk CDKN2A locus but we identified new loci on canine chromosomes 2, 5, 12, 14, 20, 26 and X. Capture and targeted sequencing of specific loci pointed towards the existence of regulatory variants in non coding regions and/or methylation mechanisms linked to risk haplotypes, leading to strong cancer predispositions in specific dog breeds. Our results showed that these canine cancer predisposing loci appear to be due to the additive effect of several risk haplotype involved also in other haematopoietic cancers such lymphoma or mast cell tumor, illustrating the pleiotropic nature of these canine cancer loci as observed in human oncology, thus reinforcing the interest of predisposed dog breeds to study cancer initiation and progression.},

  abstract = {Reproduction is a risky affair; a lifespan cost of maintaining reproductive capability, and of reproduction itself, has been demonstrated in a wide range of animal species. However, little is understood about the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Most cost-of-reproduction studies simply ask how reproduction influences age at death, but are blind to the subjects' actual causes of death. Lifespan is a composite variable of myriad causes of death and it has not been clear whether the consequences of reproduction or of reproductive capability influence all causes of death equally. To address this gap in understanding, we compared causes of death among over 40,000 sterilized and reproductively intact domestic dogs, Canis lupus familiaris. We found that sterilization was strongly associated with an increase in lifespan, and while it decreased risk of death from some causes, such as infectious disease, it actually increased risk of death from others, such as cancer. These findings suggest that to understand how reproduction affects lifespan, a shift in research focus is needed. Beyond the impact of reproduction on when individuals die, we must investigate its impact on why individuals die, and subsequently must identify the mechanisms by which these causes of death are influenced by the physiology associated with reproductive capability. Such an approach may also clarify the effects of reproduction on lifespan in people.},

  abstract = {Reproduction is a risky affair; a lifespan cost of maintaining reproductive capability, and of reproduction itself, has been demonstrated in a wide range of animal species. However, little is understood about the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Most cost-of-reproduction studies simply ask how reproduction influences age at death, but are blind to the subjects' actual causes of death. Lifespan is a composite variable of myriad causes of death and it has not been clear whether the consequences of reproduction or of reproductive capability influence all causes of death equally. To address this gap in understanding, we compared causes of death among over 40,000 sterilized and reproductively intact domestic dogs, Canis lupus familiaris. We found that sterilization was strongly associated with an increase in lifespan, and while it decreased risk of death from some causes, such as infectious disease, it actually increased risk of death from others, such as cancer. These findings suggest that to understand how reproduction affects lifespan, a shift in research focus is needed. Beyond the impact of reproduction on when individuals die, we must investigate its impact on why individuals die, and subsequently must identify the mechanisms by which these causes of death are influenced by the physiology associated with reproductive capability. Such an approach may also clarify the effects of reproduction on lifespan in people.},

  abstract = {Wright's F-statistics, and especially F ST , provide important insights into the evolutionary processes that influence the structure of genetic variation within and among populations, and they are among the most widely used descriptive statistics in population and evolutionary genetics. Estimates of F ST can identify regions of the genome that have been the target of selection, and comparisons of F ST from different parts of the genome can provide insights into the demographic history of populations. For these reasons and others, F ST has a central role in population and evolutionary genetics and has wide applications in fields that range from disease association mapping to forensic science. This Review clarifies how F ST is defined, how it should be estimated, how it is related to similar statistics and how estimates of F ST should be interpreted. Nearly every plant or animal species includes many partially isolated populations. As a result of genetic drift or divergent natural selection, such populations become genetically differentiated over time.

  abstract = {Background: Angiogenesis is a prerequisite for airway remodeling in bronchial asthma. Several growth factors may play important roles in inflammation and angiogenesis through effects on inflammatory cell infiltration or neovascularization. Objective: We sought to compare bronchial vascularity and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and angiogenin in bronchial biopsy specimens from asthmatic and healthy control subjects. Methods: Bronchial biopsy specimens were obtained from 16 asthmatic subjects and 9 normal control subjects. The number of vessel profiles and the vascular area per unit area on a histologic section were estimated by using computerized image analysis after staining for type IV collagen in vessel walls. Numbers of VEGF+, bFGF+, and angiogenin+ cells were determined by means of immunoreactivity. Results: The airways of asthmatic subjects had significantly more vessels (P \&lt; .05) and greater vascular area (P \&lt; .001) than that observed in control subjects. Asthmatic subjects exhibited higher VEGF and bFGF and angiogenin immunoreactivity in the submucosa than did control subjects (P \&lt; .001, respectively). Significant correlations were detected between the vascular area and the numbers of angiogenic factor\textendash positive cells (VEGF: rs = 0.93, P \&lt; .001; bFGF: rs = 0.83, P \&lt; .001; angiogenin: rs = 0.88, P \&lt; .001) within the asthmatic airways. Furthermore, the degree of vascularity was inversely correlated with airway caliber and airway responsiveness. Colocalization analysis revealed that the angiogenic factor\textendash positive cells were CD34+ cells, eosinophils, and macrophages.

Conversely, estrogens have been shown to accelerate recovery of the endothelium after vascular injury., Objective: To investigate whether estrogens are able to prevent senescence of EPCs., Methods and results: Human EPCs were isolated from peripheral blood and characterized. After ex-vivo cultivation, the cells became senescent as determined by acidic [beta]-galactosidase staining. 17[beta]-Estradiol dose-dependently inhibited the onset of EPC senescence in culture. Because cellular senescence is critically influenced by telomerase, which elongates telomeres, we measured telomerase activity using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. 17[beta]-Estradiol significantly increased telomerase activity. Interestingly, reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis demonstrated that 17[beta]-estradiol dose-dependently increased the catalytic subunit, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) - an effect that was significantly inhibited by pharmacological phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) blockers (either wortmannin or LY294002). Because the expression of TERT is regulated by the PI3-K/Akt pathway, we examined the effect of 17[beta]-estradiol on Akt activity in EPCs. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that 17[beta]-estradiol dose-dependently led to phosphorylation and, thus, to activation of Akt in EPCs. We also examined whether the protective effect of 17[beta]-estradiol on EPC senescence translates into the augmentation of mitogenic activity in EPCs. A [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenol)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] (MTS) assay demonstrated that the mitogenic potential in EPCs treated with 17[beta]-estradiol exceeded that in untreated (control) EPCs (P {$<$} 0.01). In addition, EPCs released vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein - an effect that was significantly augmented by 17[beta]-estradiol. Finally, in a Matrigel assay, EPCs treated with both 17[beta]-estradiol and VEGF were shown to be more likely to integrate into the network formation than those treated with VEGF alone., Conclusion: The inhibition of EPC senescence by estrogen in vitro may improve the functional activity of EPCs in a way that is important for potential cell therapy., (C) 2005 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

Interestingly, reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis demonstrated that 17[beta]-estradiol dose-dependently increased the catalytic subunit, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) - an effect that was significantly inhibited by pharmacological phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) blockers (either wortmannin or LY294002). Because the expression of TERT is regulated by the PI3-K/Akt pathway, we examined the effect of 17[beta]-estradiol on Akt activity in EPCs. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that 17[beta]-estradiol dose-dependently led to phosphorylation and, thus, to activation of Akt in EPCs. We also examined whether the protective effect of 17[beta]-estradiol on EPC senescence translates into the augmentation of mitogenic activity in EPCs. A [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenol)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] (MTS) assay demonstrated that the mitogenic potential in EPCs treated with 17[beta]-estradiol exceeded that in untreated (control) EPCs (P {$<$} 0.01). In addition, EPCs released vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein - an effect that was significantly augmented by 17[beta]-estradiol. Finally, in a Matrigel assay, EPCs treated with both 17[beta]-estradiol and VEGF were shown to be more likely to integrate into the network formation than those treated with VEGF alone., Conclusion: The inhibition of EPC senescence by estrogen in vitro may improve the functional activity of EPCs in a way that is important for potential cell therapy., (C) 2005 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

  abstract = {Dogs enrolled in a Swedish insurance company (during 1995\textendash 2006) were studied for development of pyometra and mammary tumours (MTs), with special attention to breed and age. There were over 260~000 female dogs with over 1~000~000 dog-years at risk (DYAR) in the database, using data on bitches up to 10~years of age and 110 breeds with over 1000 DYAR. In total, 20~423 bitches were diagnosed with pyometra and 11~758 with MTs and 30~131 with either or both of the two diseases. The incidence rate (IR) for pyometra was 199 (95\% CI 196\textendash 202), for MTs 112 (95\% CI 110\textendash 114) and for either or both of the two diseases 297 (95\% CI 294\textendash 301) dogs per 10~000 DYAR. The mean age of diagnosis pyometra was 7.0~years (SD~{$\pm~$}2.2), MTs 8.0~years (SD~{$\pm~$}1.6). In all breeds, the overall proportion of the bitches that developed disease by 10~years of age was for pyometra 19\%, MTs 13\%, and either or both of two diseases 30\%. The top 10 breeds diagnosed with either or both of the two diseases were the Leonberger (73\%), Irish Wolfhound (69\%), Bernese Mountain Dog (69\%), Great Dane (68\%), Staffordshire Bull Terrier (66\%), Rottweiler (65\%), Bullterrier (62\%), Doberman (62\%), Bouvier des Flandres (60\%), Airdaleterrier (60\%).

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the relative efficacy and technical ease of use of eight different agents for endoscopic hemostasis and obliteration of bleeding gastric varices in a canine model, as no comparative data are available on gastric variceal sclerotherapy. Large bleeding gastric varices in 20 heparinized dogs were randomized to endoscopic injection treatment with one of the following agents: cyanoacrylate; a 1:1:1 mixture of sodium tetra-decyl sulfate 3\%, ethanol 98\%, and normal saline solution; ethanolamine oleate 5\%; sodium morrhuate 5\%; sodium tetradecyl sulfate 1.5\%; polidocanol 1\%; normal saline solution with epinephrine 1:10,000; or normal saline solution (control). The number and volume of injections and the time required to achieve complete hemostasis were evaluated; follow-up endoscopy was performed at 1 month to assess gastric variceal obliteration. Cyanoacrylate was the best agent overall in terms of immediate efficacy, low volume requirement, time required for initial hemostasis, and reduction of gastric variceal size. Cyanoacrylate, tetradecyl sulfate, and polidocanol were the most effective agents for reducing gastric variceal size. Epinephrine was effective for controlling induced or secondary bleeding caused by puncture of the gastric varices with the sclerotherapy needle during intravariceal injections. Ongoing studies are evaluating combinations of agents with different mechanisms of action, such as epinephrine (for vasoconstriction to minimize secondary bleeding) plus alcohol, and/or tetradecyl sulfate (for variceal thrombosis and sclerosis). In addition, different concentrations of alcohol as a single agent or combined with epinephrine should be evaluated because of the relatively low cost and wide availability of these substances.

Identification of those who have a BRCA1/2 mutation is important so that they can take advantage of genetic counseling, screening, and potentially life-saving prevention strategies. We describe the design and analytic validation of the Counsyl Inherited Cancer Screen, a next-generation-sequencing-based test to detect pathogenic variation in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. We demonstrate that the test is capable of detecting single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), short insertions and deletions (indels), and copy-number variants (CNVs, also known as large rearrangements) with zero errors over a 114-sample validation set consisting of samples from cell lines and deidentified patient samples, including 36 samples with BRCA1/2 pathogenic germline mutations.},

  abstract = {The human "Elston and Ellis grading method" was used in dogs with mammary carcinoma to examine its relation to prognosis in this species, based on a 2-year follow-up period. Of the 85 cases examined, 27(31.8\%) had well-differentiated (grade I), 28 (32.9\%) had moderately differentiated (grade II) and 30 (35.3\%) had poorly differentiated (grade III) carcinomas. Two years after mastectomy, significant differences in survival between cases with different tumour grade were found; thus, survival was worse in dogs with grade III carcinomas than in those with grade II (P{$<$}0.05) or grade I (P{$<$}0.001) tumours. However, in dogs with simple carcinomas which had a less favourable prognosis than that of other carcinomas (P{$<$}0.001), there was no significant difference in survival between grade II and grade III cases (P=0.878), both having a very poor prognosis. Undifferentiated (grade III) carcinoma cases had a 21-fold increased risk of death as compared with differentiated (grade I and II) carcinoma cases. An increased risk (about 10-fold) was also associated with undifferentiated simple carcinomas as compared with differentiated ones. The predictive value of histological grade was not influenced by tumour size or age of the dog at mastectomy; nodal metastasis, however, worsened the prognosis (P{$<$}0.001). Routine use of this human grading method would help the clinician to make a more accurate prognosis in the interests of post-surgical management in dogs with mammary carcinomas. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The greyhound locus exhibiting the strongest association, located 150 kilobases upstream of the genes CDKN2A/B, is also the most rearranged locus in canine osteosarcoma tumors. The top germline candidate variant is found at a {$>$}90\% frequency in Rottweilers and Irish wolfhounds, and alters an evolutionarily constrained element that we show has strong enhancer activity in human osteosarcoma cells. In all three breeds, osteosarcoma-associated loci and regions of reduced heterozygosity are enriched for genes in pathways connected to bone differentiation and growth. Several pathways, including one of genes regulated by miR124, are also enriched for somatic copy-number changes in tumors.Conclusions: Mapping a complex cancer in multiple dog breeds reveals a polygenic spectrum of germline risk factors pointing to specific pathways as drivers of disease. \textcopyright{} 2013 Karlsson et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

It has been convincingly shown that E2 activates phosphoinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B/AKT, and stimulates ERK and p38 MAP kinases. In part, this stems from G-protein activation and the resulting calcium flux. As a result, the link between E2 action at the cell membrane and discrete biological actions in the cell has been strengthened. There is now convincing in vitro evidence that E2 can modulate the functions of neural and vascular cells via non-genomic actions. Thus, the actions of discrete pools of E2 receptors are likely to contribute to the overall effects of the sex steroids.},

Robust diagnosis of HM commonly utilizes immunohistochemical stains that are broadly ineffective on formalin-fixed tissues; thus the diagnosis is often one of exclusion. Clinical outcomes are generally poor, with frequent metastasis and therapeutic failure lowering overall survival at time of diagnosis to an average of less than two months in the majority of published work. The limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HM has hindered the development of more effective diagnostic modalities and the identification of therapeutic targets. A potential avenue exists for advancing clinical management of canine cancers through extrapolation from a close counterpart in human medicine. Historically, HM have been compared to the rare and understudied subset of human cancers involving the dendritic lineage, such as dendritic cell sarcoma or Langerhans cell sarcoma. Recent data have now thrown into question the cellular origin of HM, suggesting that the disease may originate from the macrophage lineage. This review summarizes existing knowledge of HM from the clinical, histologic and molecular perspectives, and highlights avenues for future research that may aid the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In turn, a more advanced appreciation of the mechanisms underlying HM should clarify their cellular origin and identify appropriate opportunities for synergistic extrapolation between related canine and human cancers.},

  abstract = {Canine histiocytic malignancies (HM) are rare across the general dog population, but overrepresented in certain breeds, such as Bernese mountain dog and flat-coated retriever. Accurate diagnosis relies on immunohistochemical staining to rule out histologically similar cancers with different prognoses and treatment strategies (e.g., lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma). HM are generally treatment refractory with overall survival of less than 6~months. A lack of understanding regarding the mechanisms of disease development and progression hinders development of novel therapeutics. While the study of human tumors can benefit veterinary medicine, the rarity of the suggested orthologous disease (dendritic cell sarcoma) precludes this. This study aims to improve the understanding of underlying disease mechanisms using genome-wide DNA copy number and gene expression analysis of spontaneous HM across several dog breeds. Extensive DNA copy number disruption was evident, with losses of segments of chromosomes 16 and 31 detected in 93\% and 72\% of tumors, respectively. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) evaluation of these regions in numerous cancer specimens effectively discriminated HM from other common round cell tumors, including lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma, resulting in a novel, rapid diagnostic aid for veterinary medicine. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated disruption of the spindle assembly complex, which is linked to genomic instability and reduced therapeutic impact in humans. A key signature detected was up-regulation of Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), supported by an immunohistochemistry-based assessment of MMP9 protein levels. Since MMP9 has been linked with rapid metastasis and tumor aggression in humans, the data in this study offer a possible mechanism of aggression in HM.},

To assess potential effects of IL-8 in other tumor constituents, we stratified HSA cell lines and whole tumor samples into ``IL-8 high'' and ``IL-8 low'' groups. Genome-wide gene expression profiling showed that samples in the ``IL-8 high'' tumor group were enriched for genes associated with a ``reactive microenvironment,'' including activation of coagulation, inflammation, and fibrosis networks. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the effects of IL-8 on these tumors were mostly indirect, regulating interactions with the microenvironment.

  abstract = {Cutaneous mast cell tumors (MCTs) are one of the most common tumors in dogs. Currently, prognostic and therapeutic determinations for MCTs are primarily based on the histologic grade of the tumor, but a vast majority of MCTs are of an intermediate grade, and the prognostic relevance is highly questioned. A more detailed prognostic evaluation, especially of grade 2 canine MCTs, is greatly needed. To evaluate the prognostic significance of KIT and tryptase expression patterns in canine cutaneous MCTs, we studied 100 cutaneous MCTs from 100 dogs that had been treated with surgery only. The total survival and disease-free survival time and the time to local or distant recurrence of MCTs were recorded for all dogs. Using immuno-histochemistry, 98 of these MCTs were stained with anti-KIT and antitryptase antibodies. Three KIT- and three tryptase-staining patterns were identified. The KIT-staining patterns were identified as 1) membrane-associated staining, 2) focal to stippled cytoplasmic staining with decreased membrane-associated staining, and 3) diffuse cytoplasmic staining. The tryptase-staining patterns were identified as 1) diffuse cytoplasmic staining, 2) stippled cytoplasmic staining, and 3) little to no cytoplasmic staining. Based on univariate and multivariate survival analysis, increased cytoplasmic KIT staining was significantly associated with an increased rate of local recurrence and a decreased survival rate. The tryptase-staining patterns were not significantly associated with any survival parameter. On the basis of these results, we propose a new prognostic classification of canine cutaneous MCTs, according to their KIT-staining pattern, that can be used for the routine prognostic evaluation of canine cutaneous MCTs.},

  abstract = {Cutaneous mast cell tumors (MCTs) are one of the most common tumors in dogs. Currently, prognostic and therapeutic determinations for MCTs are primarily based on the histologic grade of the tumor, but a vast majority of MCTs are of an intermediate grade, and the prognostic relevance is highly questioned. A more detailed prognostic evaluation, especially of grade 2 canine MCTs, is greatly needed. To evaluate the prognostic significance of KIT and tryptase expression patterns in canine cutaneous MCTs, we studied 100 cutaneous MCTs from 100 dogs that had been treated with surgery only. The total survival and disease-free survival time and the time to local or distant recurrence of MCTs were recorded for all dogs. Using immuno-histochemistry, 98 of these MCTs were stained with anti-KIT and antitryptase antibodies. Three KIT- and three tryptase-staining patterns were identified. The KIT-staining patterns were identified as 1) membrane-associated staining, 2) focal to stippled cytoplasmic staining with decreased membrane-associated staining, and 3) diffuse cytoplasmic staining. The tryptase-staining patterns were identified as 1) diffuse cytoplasmic staining, 2) stippled cytoplasmic staining, and 3) little to no cytoplasmic staining. Based on univariate and multivariate survival analysis, increased cytoplasmic KIT staining was significantly associated with an increased rate of local recurrence and a decreased survival rate. The tryptase-staining patterns were not significantly associated with any survival parameter. On the basis of these results, we propose a new prognostic classification of canine cutaneous MCTs, according to their KIT-staining pattern, that can be used for the routine prognostic evaluation of canine cutaneous MCTs.},

  abstract = {In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field.},

  abstract = {: The aneurysmal bone cyst is the result of a specific pathophysiologic change, which is probably the result of trauma or a tumor-induced anomalous vascular process. In approximately one third of cases, the preexisting lesion can be clearly identified. The most common of these is the giant cell tumor, which accounts for 19-39\% of cases in which the preceding lesion is found. Other common precursor lesions include osteoblastoma, angioma, and chondroblastoma. Less common lesions include fibrous dysplasia, fibroxanthoma (nonossifying fibroma), chondromyxoid fibroma, solitary bone cyst, fibrous histiocytoma, eosinophilic granuloma, and even osteosarcoma. Interestingly, some of the controversy surrounding this lesion may be the result of a change in how the lesion was defined by Lichtenstein in 1953, when intramedullary lesions were added to the previously described juxtacortical (superficial) lesions. Members of the AFIP have suggested that many of the intramedullary lesions in which no previous lesion can be identified may represent giant cell tumors of bone. Their similarity to proved giant cell tumors in skeletally immature patients can be striking and seems more than coincidental. Appropriate treatment of an aneurysmal bone cyst requires the realization that it results from a specific pathophysiologic process, and identification of the preexisting lesion, if possible, is essential. Clearly an osteosarcoma with superimposed secondary aneurysmal bone cyst change must be treated as an osteosarcoma, and giant cell tumor with secondary features of aneurysmal bone cyst would be expected to be more likely to recur locally. The vast majority (approximately 80\%) of patients presenting with aneurysmal bone cystlike findings are less than 20 years old. More than half of all such lesions occur in long bones, with approximately 12-30\% of cases occurring in the spine. The pelvis accounts for about half of all flat bone lesions. Most patients present with pain and/or swelling, with symptoms usually present for less than 6 months. The imaging appearance of aneurysmal bone cyst reflects the underlying pathophysiologic change. Radiographs show an eccentric, lytic lesion with an expanded, remodeled "blown-out" or "ballooned" bony contour of the host bone, frequently with a delicate trabeculated appearance. Radiographs may rarely show flocculent densities within the lesion, which may mimic chondroid matrix. CT scanning will define the lesion and is especially valuable for those lesions located in areas in which the bony anatomy is complex, and which are not adequately evaluated by plain films. Fluid-fluid levels are common and may be seen on CT scans and MR images.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Treatment response was evaluated radiographically and clinically. Cyst fluid was classified as clear, partially bloody, or bloody. Presence of any venous drainage of the cyst was assessed by injection of contrast medium into the cyst cavity.ResultsTwenty-nine children with ages ranging from 2 to 16 years were included. Treatment response was good in 17 (59\%), partial in 9 (31\%), and poor in 3 (10\%) children. Venous drainage was absent in six out of seven clear-fluid cysts, which we classified as lymphatic. Drainage was present in all seven bloody-fluid cysts, which we classified as venous. In seven partially bloody-fluid cysts, venous drainage was seen in three.ConclusionSclerotherapy with absolute alcohol is a safe and effective treatment of ABC. We propose classifying ABC as lymphatic or venous and suggest considering ABC intraosseous slow-flow vascular malformations.},

In dogs it is a heritable trait, with both environmental and genetic factors contributing to the phenotype. The prevalence of patellar luxation in the Dutch Flat-Coated Retriever population is 24\%. In this study, we investigated the molecular genetics of the disorder in this population. Genome-wide association analysis of 15,823 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 45 cases and 40 controls revealed that patellar luxation was significantly associated with a region on chromosome CFA07, and possibly with regions on CFA03, CFA31, and CFA36. The exons of the genes in these regions, 0.5~Mb combined, were analyzed further. These exons from 15 cases and a pooled sample from 15 controls were enriched using custom genomic hybridization arrays and analyzed by massive parallel DNA sequencing. In total 7257 variations were detected. Subsequently, a selection of 144 of these SNPs were genotyped in 95 Flat-Coated Retrievers. Nine SNPs, in eight genes on CFA07 and CFA31, were associated with patellar luxation (P {$<$}10-4). Genotyping of these SNPs in samples from a variety of breeds revealed that the disease-associated allele of one synonymous SNP in a pseudogene of FMO6 was unique to Flat-Coated Retrievers. Genome-wide association analysis followed by targeted DNA sequencing identified loci on chromosomes 7 and 31 as being involved in patellar luxation in the Flat-Coated Retriever breed.},

The evaluation of patient-specific translocations in leukemias and lymphomas has revolutionized diagnostics for these diseases. We have developed a method, called personalized analysis of rearranged ends (PARE), which can identify translocations in solid tumors. Analysis of four colorectal and two breast cancers with massively parallel sequencing revealed an average of nine rearranged sequences (range, 4 to 15) per tumor. Polymerase chain reaction with primers spanning the breakpoints was able to detect mutant DNA molecules present at levels lower than 0.001\% and readily identified mutated circulating DNA in patient plasma samples. This approach provides an exquisitely sensitive and broadly applicable approach for the development of personalized biomarkers to enhance the clinical management of cancer patients.},

  abstract = {The chemical treatment of cancer started with the realization that DNA damaging agents such as mustard gas present notable antitumoural properties. Consequently, early drug development focused on genotoxic chemicals, some of which are still widely used in the clinic. However, the efficacy of such therapies is often limited by the side effects of these drugs on healthy cells. A refinement to this approach is to use compounds that can exploit the presence of DNA damage in cancer cells. Given that replication stress (RS) is a major source of genomic instability in cancer, targeting the RS-response kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) has emerged as a promising alternative. With ATR inhibitors now entering clinical trials, we here revisit the biology behind this strategy and discuss potential biomarkers that could be used for a better selection of patients who respond to therapy. This Opinion provides insight into the potential of targeting the replication stress response in cancer and discusses the strategy of inhibiting ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and the need for reliable biomarkers to enable patient stratification.},

  abstract = {Nucleic acid sample storage is of paramount importance in forensic science as well as in epidemiological, clinical, and genetic laboratories. Millions of biological samples, including cells, viruses, and DNA/RNA, are stored every year for diagnostics, research, and forensic science. PCR has permitted the analysis of minute sample quantities. Samples such as bone, teeth, touch samples, and some sexual assault evidence may yield only low-quality and low-quantity DNA/RNA. Efficient storage of the extracted DNA/RNA is needed to ensure the stability of the sample over time for retesting of the CODIS STRs, mtDNA, YSTRs, mRNA, and other future marker-typing systems. Amplification of some or all of these markers may fail because the biological material has been highly degraded, contains inhibitors, is too low in quantity, or is contaminated with contemporary DNA. Reduction in recovery has been observed with refrigerated liquid DNA extracts and also those exposed to multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Therefore, the development of optimal storage and amplification methods is critical for successful recovery of profiles from these types of samples since, in many cases, retesting is necessary. This chapter is divided into three sections. The Introduction (Section 2.1) reviews forensic DNA storage, factors that influence DNA stability, and a brief review of molecular strategies to type nonoptimal DNA. Section 2.2 discusses the importance of DNA extract storage in forensic and nonforensic DNA databanks and the mechanisms responsible for loss during storage. Finally, Section 2.3 describes strategies and technologies being utilized to store DNA.},

  abstract = {The B-RafV599E-mediated constitutive activation of ERK1/2 is involved in establishing the transformed phenotype of some uveal melanoma cells (Calipel, A., Lefevre, G., Pouponnot, C., Mouriaux, F., Eychene, A., and Mascarelli, F. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 42409\textendash 42418). We have shown that stem cell factor (SCF) is involved in the proliferation of normal uveal melanocytes and that c-Kit is expressed in 75\% of primary uveal melanomas. This suggests that the acquisition of autonomous growth during melanoma progression may involve the SCF/c-Kit axis. We used six human uveal melanoma tumor-derived cell lines and normal uveal melanocytes to characterize the SCF/c-Kit system and to assess its specific role in transformation. We investigated the possible roles of activating mutations in c-KIT, the overexpression of this gene, and ligand-dependent c-Kit overactivation in uveal melanoma cell tumorigenesis. Four cell lines (92.1, SP6.5, Mel270, and TP31) expressed both SCF and c-Kit, and none harbored the c-KIT mutations in exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 that have been shown to induce SCF-independent c-Kit activation. Melanoma cell proliferation was strongly inhibited by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of c-Kit in these cells, despite the presence of V599EB-Raf in SP6.5 and TP31 cells. We characterized the signaling pathways involved in SCF/c-Kit-mediated cell growth and survival in normal and tumoral melanocytes and found that constitutive ERK1/2 activation played a key role in both the SCF/c-Kit autocrine loop and the gain of function of V599EB-Raf for melanoma cell proliferation and transformation. We also provide the first evidence that Glivec\textregistered/STI571, a c-Kit tyrosine kinase inhibitor, could be used to treat uveal melanomas.},

The dog is of particular interest because it provides important evolutionary information and because existing breeds show great phenotypic diversity for morphological, physiological and behavioural traits. We use sequence comparison with the primate and rodent lineages to shed light on the structure and evolution of genomes and genes. Notably, the majority of the most highly conserved non-coding sequences in mammalian genomes are clustered near a small subset of genes with important roles in development.

  abstract = {Here we report a high-quality draft genome sequence of the domestic dog (Canis familiaris), together with a dense map of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across breeds. The dog is of particular interest because it provides important evolutionary information and because existing breeds show great phenotypic diversity for morphological, physiological and behavioural traits. We use sequence comparison with the primate and rodent lineages to shed light on the structure and evolution of genomes and genes. Notably, the majority of the most highly conserved non-coding sequences in mammalian genomes are clustered near a small subset of genes with important roles in development. Analysis of SNPs reveals long-range haplotypes across the entire dog genome, and defines the nature of genetic diversity within and across breeds. The current SNP map now makes it possible for genome-wide association studies to identify genes responsible for diseases and traits, with important consequences for human and companion animal health.},

In spite of this decrease in FeLV infection, the incidence of lymphoma in cats treated at the VMTH actually increased from 1982 to 2003. This increase was due largely to a rise in the incidence of intestinal lymphoma, and to a lesser degree, of atypical lymphoma.

Associations of intestinal lymphoma and inflammatory bowel disease and diet should be further considered},

We integrated behavioural data from more than 14 000 dogs from 101 breeds with breed-averaged genotypic data (n = 5697 dogs) from over 100 000 loci in the dog genome. We found high levels of among-breed heritability for 14 behavioural traits (the proportion of trait variance attributable to genetic similarity among breeds). We next identified 131 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with breed differences in behaviour, which were found in genes that are highly expressed in the brain and enriched for neurobiological functions and developmental processes, suggesting that they may be functionally associated with behavioural differences. Our results shed light on the heritability and genetic architecture of complex behavioural traits and identify dogs as a powerful model in which to address these questions.},

Cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), the feline analogue to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are reported to be at increased incidence of neoplasia. This review highlights reported risk factors and tumor cell phenotypes associated with neoplasias arising in FIV-infected animals, differences in oncogenic disease in natural versus experimental FIV infections, and similarities between FIV- and HIV-related malignancies. The most common type of FIV-associated neoplasm reported in the literature is lymphoma, specifically of B-cell origin, with experimentally infected cats developing neoplastic lesions at an earlier age than their naturally infected cohorts. The mechanism of FIV-induced lymphoma has not been completely ascertained, though the majority of published studies addressing this issue suggest oncogenesis arises via indirect mechanisms. HIV-infected individuals have increased risk of neoplasia, specifically B cell lymphoma, in comparison with uninfected individuals. Additional similarities between FIV- and HIV-associated neoplasms include the presence of extranodal lymphoma, a synergism with other oncogenic viruses, and an apparent indirect mechanism of induced oncogenesis. This literature supports study of FIV-associated neoplasms to further characterize this lentiviral-neoplasia association for the benefit of both human and animal disease, and to advance our general knowledge of mechanisms for viral-induced oncogenesis.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2018 Public Library of Science. All rights reserved. Gir is one of the main cattle breeds raised in tropical South American countries. Strong artificial selection through its domestication resulted in increased genetic differentiation among the countries in recent years. Over the years, genomic studies in Gir have become more common. However, studies of population structure and signatures of selection in divergent Gir populations are scarce and need more attention to better understand genetic differentiation, gene flow, and genetic distance. Genotypes of 173 animals selected for growth traits and 273 animals selected for milk production were used in this study. Clear genetic differentiation between beef and dairy populations was observed. Different criteria led to genetic divergence and genetic differences in allele frequencies between the two populations. Gene segregation in each population was forced by artificial selection, promoting isolation, and increasing genetic variation between them. Results showed evidence of selective forces in different regions of the genome. A total of 282 genes were detected under selection in the test population based on the fixation index (Fst), integrated haplotype score (iHS), and cross-population extend haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH) approaches. The QTL mapping identified 35 genes associated with reproduction, milk composition, growth, meat and carcass, health, or body conformation traits. The investigation of genes and pathways showed that quantitative traits associated to fertility, milk production, beef quality, and growth were involved in the process of differentiation of these populations. These results would support further investigations of population structure and differentiation in the Gir breed.},

  abstract = {The aims of this study were to assess genetic variances, trends and mode of inheritance for hip and elbow dysplasia in Finnish dog populations. The influence of time-dependent fixed effects in the model when estimating the genetic trends was also studied. Official hip and elbow dysplasia screening records of 42 421 dogs from seven breeds were analysed with REML. To investigate the mode of inheritance of hip and elbow dysplasia, trait distributions, genetic variances and regressions of offspring phenotypes on parental predicted breeding values were studied separately in males and in females. Genetic trends for hip dysplasia between the years 1983 and 1998 were favourable only in the Rottweiler. In elbow dysplasia, the trends were favourable after the year 1992 in all the four breeds studied but the overall changes were small. The reason for this seemed to be negligible selection pressure against these traits. Time-dependent fixed effects in the model had an influence on the estimated genetic trends, resulting either in a more negative or more positive genetic trend compared with the model from which the time-dependent effects were removed. Mitochondrial or sex-linked inheritance did not seem likely in the expression of hip and elbow dysplasia in the populations studied. Regression coefficients of offspring phenotypes on estimated parental breeding values were approximately equal to their expected value in a situation with equal parental contribution. Furthermore, the phenotypic frequency distributions of hip and elbow dysplasia grades were similar among males and females in each breed studied. No indication of major genes was found in the offspring frequency distributions within individual sires. According to these Finnish data, mode of inheritance for both hip and elbow dysplasia is polygenic (quantitative) with equal expression of the genes from both parents, although the estimates of heritability for hip dysplasia in the Rough Collie and for elbow dysplasia in the German Shepherd and the Golden Retriever were somewhat different in males compared with females.},

This study evaluates the effects on bone of 1,25-(OH)2D3 therapy using the ovariohysterectomized dog model. The cessation of ovarian function was ascertained by an increase in serum LH levels 4 weeks after ovariohysterectomy, and significant bone loss was revealed four months after ovariohysterectomy. The bone loss was associated with an increase in the number of bone-forming cells and a decrease in the activity of these cells. The administration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 increased the activity of the bone cells and resulted in a reversal of all abnormalities in structural parameters of bone, including cancellous bone mass, trabecular wall thickness, trabecular plate separation, trabecular plate density, and trabecular plate thickness (which increased above normal). However, 1,25-(OH)2D3 therapy was also associated with a significant decrease in the number of bone-forming cells, resulting in lower bone formation at the tissue level. The results of this study indicate that 1,25-(OH)2D3 therapy can reverse the bone loss and osteoblastic insufficiency responsible for the maintenance of negative bone balance after the cessation of ovarian function. However, this therapy has a suppressive effect on bone cell number and bone turnover. This undesired side-effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 therapy renders a chronic therapeutic regimen inefficient for the long term management of patients with osteoporosis. Intermittent 1,25-(OH)2D3 therapy or a sequential therapy using 1,25-(OH)2D3 along with substances known to increase the number of bone-forming cells is strongly suggested by these results.},

  abstract = {A group of 639 bone lesions was reviewed in order to study the features of the aneurysmal bone cyst and its association with other conditions. A diagnosis of primary aneurysmal bone cyst not associated with any other bone lesion was made in 87 patients. In 36 additional patients the gross and microscopic changes of aneurysmal bone cyst were identified as part of some other solid bone lesion. Fourteen of these additional cases were associated with giant cell tumor (96 cases studied), six with chondroblastoma (41 cases studied), three with chondromyxoid fibroma (45 cases studied), two with nonossifying fibroma (68 cases studied), four with osteoblastoma (61 cases studied), one with fibrosarcoma (50 cases studied), three with fibrous histiocytoma (45 cases studied), two with osteosarcoma (100 cases studied), and one with fibrous dysplasia (42 cases studied). The age, site, and sex distribution of the cases associated with another lesion compares closely with that of the solid lesion concerned, supporting the concept that the aneurysmal bone cyst component is secondary.},

  abstract = {Objective: Many biomedical journals have introduced disclosure of research contribution in journal articles as a way to limit irresponsible authorship. Over the years, journals have developed different contribution disclosure policies and procedures, but it is not known how these policies and procedures affect authorship. The aim of our study was to analyse possible causative relationships between the structure of the contribution disclosure form and the number of authors who do not meet authorship criteria in biomedicine set by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). Research design and methods: In a single-blind randomized trial, 1462 authors of 332 manuscripts submitted to a general medical journal answered one of three different contribution disclosure forms: (1) open-ended - asking the respondents to describe in their own words their contributions in the submitted work; (2) categorical - with 11 possible contribution choices and (3) instructional - guiding through the ICMJE definition and instructing how many contributions are needed to satisfy individual criteria. Main outcome measure: The number of authors not satisfying ICMJE authorship criteria. Results: The group answering the instructional form had significantly fewer authors whose reported contributions did not satisfy ICMJE criteria (18.7\%) than the groups answering the categorical (62.8\%) or open-ended (54.7\%) form ({$\chi$} 2 2 = 210.833, p {$<$} 0.001). The group receiving instructional forms also had the fewest articles with honorary authors (32.5\%) compared with those who responded in a categorical (68.7\%) or open-ended (83.0\%) form ({$\chi$} 2 2 = 63.378, p {$<$} 0.001). All authors who answered the open-ended form, regardless of their compliance with authorship criteria, reported significantly fewer contributions (median 3 [95\% confidence interval = 3-3]) than authors responding to either the categorical (4 [4-4] ; zscore = -7.1899, p {$<$} 0.001) or instructional form (4 [4-5]; z score = -13.9760, p {$<$} 0.001). Honorary authors answering the instructional form reported more contributions than those answering either the categorical or open-ended form (z score = 2.7637, p = 0.0057 and z score = 3.3773, p {$<$} 0.001, respectively). Most honorary authors (39.9\%) lacked only the third ICMJE criterion (final approval of the submitted manuscript). Conclusions: The structure of the contribution disclosure form significantly influenced the number of contributions reported by authors of submitted manuscripts and their compliance with the ICMJE authorship criteria. Journal editors should be aware of the cognitive aspects of survey methodology when they construct for their authors self-reports about behaviour, such as contribution disclosure forms. \textcopyright{} 2006 Librapharm Limited.},

It has been reported previously that estrogens activate the signal-transducing Src/p21ras/Erk pathway in human breast cancer cells via an interaction of estrogen receptor (ER) with c-Src. We now show that progestins stimulate human breast cancer T47D cell proliferation and induce a similar rapid and transient activation of the pathway which, surprisingly, is blocked not only by anti-progestins but also by anti-estrogens. In Cos-7 cells transfected with the B isoform of progesterone receptor (PRB), progestin activation of the MAP kinase pathway depends on co-transfection of ER. A transcriptionally inactive PRB mutant also activates the signaling pathway, demonstrating that this activity is independent of transcriptional effects. PRB does not interact with c-Src but associates via the N-terminal 168 amino acids with ER. This association is required for the signaling pathway activation by progestins. We propose that ER transmits to the Src/p21ras/Erk pathway signals received from the agonist-activated PRB.

  abstract = {Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is widespread in humans world-wide. The virus, which is linked to Burkitt's and Hodgkin lymphoma in humans, has recently been detected in pet dogs in Taiwan. The aim of this study was to determine if EBV is present in other canine populations, whether infection is associated with lymphoma in dogs, and whether infection is present in cats. Canine and feline serum samples were analysed by immunofluorescence assay. Antibodies to EBV or an EBV-like virus were detected in 38.4\% of UK dog sera, 64\% of US dog sera and 38\% of cat sera. Canine blood samples, tissue samples from the palatine tonsil and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy samples from canine lymphoma cases were analysed by PCR. Using EBV-specific primers, EBV was detected in one tonsil sample, whereas all other samples tested were negative. PCR using consensus herpesvirus primers identified canine herpesvirus in twelve tonsil samples and one biopsy but no gammaherpesviruses were detected. Canine blood samples from EBV antibody-positive dogs were analysed by RT-PCR to determine if transcripts associated with lytic EBV infection (BcLF1) or latency (LMP2) were present, however all samples tested were negative. In conclusion, there is serological evidence of exposure to EBV or an EBV-like virus in dogs and cats but persistent infection in the canine palatine tonsil is rare and no evidence was found of EBV in canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The effect of EBV on canine and feline cells and the possible outcome of the infection for the host require further investigation.},

  abstract = {Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is widespread in humans world-wide. The virus, which is linked to Burkitt's and Hodgkin lymphoma in humans, has recently been detected in pet dogs in Taiwan. The aim of this study was to determine if EBV is present in other canine populations, whether infection is associated with lymphoma in dogs, and whether infection is present in cats. Canine and feline serum samples were analysed by immunofluorescence assay. Antibodies to EBV or an EBV-like virus were detected in 38.4\% of UK dog sera, 64\% of US dog sera and 38\% of cat sera. Canine blood samples, tissue samples from the palatine tonsil and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy samples from canine lymphoma cases were analysed by PCR. Using EBV-specific primers, EBV was detected in one tonsil sample, whereas all other samples tested were negative. PCR using consensus herpesvirus primers identified canine herpesvirus in twelve tonsil samples and one biopsy but no gammaherpesviruses were detected. Canine blood samples from EBV antibody-positive dogs were analysed by RT-PCR to determine if transcripts associated with lytic EBV infection (BcLF1) or latency (LMP2) were present, however all samples tested were negative. In conclusion, there is serological evidence of exposure to EBV or an EBV-like virus in dogs and cats but persistent infection in the canine palatine tonsil is rare and no evidence was found of EBV in canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The effect of EBV on canine and feline cells and the possible outcome of the infection for the host require further investigation.},

  abstract = {Considerable clinical and molecular variations have been known in retinal blinding diseases in man and also in dogs. Different forms of retinal diseases occur in specific breed(s) caused by mutations segregating within each isolated breeding population. While molecular studies to find genes and mutations underlying retinal diseases in dogs have benefited largely from the phenotypic and genetic uniformity within a breed, within- and across-breed variations have often played a key role in elucidating the molecular basis. The increasing knowledge of phenotypic, allelic, and genetic heterogeneities in canine retinal degeneration has shown that the overall picture is rather more complicated than initially thought. Over the past 20 years, various approaches have been developed and tested to search for genes and mutations underlying genetic traits in dogs, depending on the availability of genetic tools and sample resources. Candidate gene, linkage analysis, and genome-wide association studies have so far identified 24 mutations in 18 genes underlying retinal diseases in at least 58 dog breeds. Many of these genes have been associated with retinal diseases in humans, thus providing opportunities to study the role in pathogenesis and in normal vision. Application in therapeutic interventions such as gene therapy has proven successful initially in a naturally occurring dog model followed by trials in human patients. Other genes whose human homologs have not been associated with retinal diseases are potential candidates to explain equivalent human diseases and contribute to the understanding of their function in vision. \textcopyright{} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract = {Activating mutations of the BRAF gene lead to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. Although many human cancers carry the mutated BRAF gene, this mutation has not yet been characterized in canine cancers. As human and canine cancers share molecular abnormalities, we hypothesized that BRAF gene mutations also exist in canine cancers. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced the exon 15 of BRAF, mutation hot spot of the gene, in 667 canine primary tumors and 38 control tissues. Sequencing analysis revealed that a single nucleotide T to A transversion at nucleotide 1349 occurred in 64 primary tumors (9.6\%), with particularly high frequency in prostatic carcinoma (20/25, 80\%) and urothelial carcinoma (30/45, 67\%). This mutation results in the amino acid substitution of glutamic acid for valine at codon 450 (V450E) of canine BRAF, corresponding to the most common BRAF mutation in human cancer, V600E. The evolutional conservation of the BRAF V600E mutation highlights the importance of MAPK pathway activation in neoplasia and may offer opportunity for molecular diagnostics and targeted therapeutics for dogs bearing BRAF-mutated cancers.},

  abstract = {Canine cutaneous histiocytoma (CCH) is a common, benign neoplasm of the dog. Histiocytomas most commonly occur as solitary lesions that undergo spontaneous regression. The age-specific incidence rate for histiocytomas drops precipitously after 3 years, although histiocytomas occur in dogs of all ages. Langerhans cells (LCs) in humans and dogs express abundant major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and a variety of leukocyte antigens characteristic of dendritic cell differentiation including CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, and CD11c. The immunophenotype of CCH resembled that of cutaneous LCs by virtue of the expression of CD1 molecules (CD1a, -b, and -c), CD11c, and major histocompatibility complex class II. Furthermore, histiocytoma cells had a tropism for epidermis, which was also consistent with an epidermal LC lineage. The expression of adhesion molecules such as CD11b (variable), CD44, CD54 (ICAM-1), and CD49d (VLA-4) in CCH indicated that the infiltrating cells had some of the characteristics of activated LCs, as these molecules are not expressed by normal, resting canine epidermal LCs. CCH did not express Thy-1 or CD4. Thy-1 expression is a characteristic of human and canine dermal dendrocytes, which are perivascular dendritic antigen-presenting cells closely related to epidermal LCs. CD4 expression is prevalent in human LC histiocytosis, and in this respect CCH differed from human LC histiocytosis. Here we demonstrate that CCH is a localized form of self-limiting LC histiocytosis, which predominantly expresses an epidermal LC phenotype. CCH occurs as solitary or, less commonly, as multiple cutaneous nodules or plaques, which rarely may extend beyond the skin to local lymph nodes. Regression of CCH occurs spontaneously in the vast majority of cases in primary and secondary sites, and is mediated by CD8+ alpha beta T cells. The high frequency of CCH within the general canine population offers the potential that the dog may provide an interesting model system to further the understanding of LC proliferative disorders, particularly the self-limiting, cutaneous form of human LC histiocytosis.},

A common element to these diseases is proliferation of dendritic cells (DC) of either Langerhans cell (epithelial DC) or interstitial DC lineage. In this report, 17 dogs with hemophagocytic HS are described. Breeds affected included Bernese Mountain Dog (6), Golden Retriever (4), Rottweiler (3), Labrador Retriever (2), a mixed-breed dog, and a Schnauzer, which were from 2.5 to 13 years old. The dogs presented with Coombs negative responsive anemia in 16/17 dogs (94\%), thrombocytopenia in 15/17 dogs (88\%), hypoalbuminemia in 16/17 dogs (94\%), and hypocholesterolemia in 11/16 dogs (69\%). All dogs died or were euthanized. The clinical course ranged from 2 to 32 weeks (mean 7.1 weeks). Diffuse splenomegaly with ill-defined masses was consistently present. Microscopic lesions were prevalent in spleen, liver, lung, and bone marrow. Metastasis occurred by insidious intravascular invasion with minimal mass formation. Histiocytes were markedly erythrophagocytic and accompanied by foci of extramedullary hemopoiesis. Cytologically, the histiocytes varied from well differentiated to atypical, with atypia more prevalent in spleen than bone marrow. These tumors arose from splenic red pulp and bone marrow macrophages, which expressed major histocompatibility complex class II and the {$\beta$}2 integrin, CD11d. They had low and/or inconsistent expression of CD1 and CD11c, which are dominantly expressed by canine nonhemophagocytic HS of DC origin. Canine histiocytic proliferative diseases now encompass proliferation of all members of the myeloid histiocytic lineage: Langerhans cells, interstitial DC, and macrophages.},

  abstract = {Histiocytic proliferative disorders are commonly observed in dogs and less often cats. Histiocytic disorders occur in most of the dendritic cell (DC) lineages. Canine cutaneous histiocytoma originates from Langerhans cells (LCs) indicated by expression of CD1a, CD11c/CD18, and E-cadherin. When histiocytomas occur as multiple lesions in skin with optional metastasis to lymph nodes and internal organs, the disease resembles cutaneous Langerhans cell histiocytosis of humans. Langerhans cell disorders do not occur in feline skin. Feline pulmonary LCH has been recognized as a cause of respiratory failure due to diffuse pulmonary infiltration by histiocytes, which express CD18 and E-cadherin and contain Birbeck's granules. In dogs and cats, histiocytic sarcomas (HS) arise from interstitial DCs that occur in most tissues of the body. Histiocytic sarcomas begin as localized lesions, which rapidly disseminate to many organs. Primary sites include spleen, lung, skin, brain (meninges), lymph node, bone marrow, and synovial tissues of limbs. An indolent form of localized HS, progressive histiocytosis, originates in the skin of cats. Hemophagocytic HS originates in splenic red pulp and bone marrow macrophages in dogs and cats. In dogs, histiocytes in hemophagocytic HS express CD11d/CD18, which is a leuko-integrin highly expressed by macrophages in splenic red pulp and bone marrow. Canine reactive histiocytic diseases, systemic histiocytosis (SH) and cutaneous histiocytosis, are complex inflammatory diseases with underlying immune dysregulation. The lesions are dominated by activated interstitial DCs and lymphocytes, which invade vessel walls and extend as vasocentric infiltrates in skin, lymph nodes, and internal organs (SH). \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2013.},

  abstract = {The histiocytoses are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by an excessive number of histiocytes. In most cases the pathophysiology is unclear and treatment is nonspecific. Faisalabad histiocytosis (FHC) (MIM 602782) has been classed as an autosomal recessively inherited form of histiocytosis with similarities to Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) (also known as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (SHML)). To elucidate the molecular basis of FHC, we performed autozygosity mapping studies in a large consanguineous family and identified a novel locus at chromosome 10q22.1. Mutation analysis of candidate genes within the target interval identified biallelic germline mutations in SLC29A3 in the FHC kindred and in two families reported to have familial RDD. Analysis of SLC29A3 expression during mouse embryogenesis revealed widespread expression by e14.5 with prominent expression in the central nervous system, eye, inner ear, and epithelial tissues including the gastrointestinal tract. SLC29A3 encodes an intracellular equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hENT3) with affinity for adenosine. Recently germline mutations in SLC29A3 were also described in two rare autosomal recessive disorders with overlapping phenotypes: (a) H syndrome (MIM 612391) that is characterised by cutaneous hyperpigmentation and hypertrichosis, hepatomegaly, heart anomalies, hearing loss, and hypogonadism; and (b) PHID (pigmented hypertrichosis with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) syndrome. Our findings suggest that a variety of clinical diagnoses (H and PHID syndromes, FHC, and familial RDD) can be included in a new diagnostic category of SLC29A3 spectrum disorder.},

In addition, data were collected from flat-coated retrievers known to have suffered from a neoplastic condition and for which a histopathological report was available. A total of 1023 submissions was obtained from 782 dogs. These included 165 non-neoplastic lesions (16 per cent), 447 benign samples (44 per cent) and 411 malignant samples (40 per cent). Soft tissue sarcomas accounted for 55 per cent of the malignant samples (26 per cent of all tumour samples and 22 per cent of all submissions) with 63 per cent of them being diagnosed as undifferentiated. Carcinomas accounted for 20 per cent of malignant samples (8 per cent of all submissions). Of the benign tumours, cutaneous histiocytoma was the most common diagnosis (48 per cent of benign tumours, 25 per cent of all tumours and 21 per cent of all submissions).},

In an attempt to classify these tumors further, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from 14 undifferentiated sarcomas from Flat-Coated Retrievers were reviewed and examined with a panel of histologic and immunohistochemical stains. The panel included vimentin, desmin, Myo D1, smooth muscle actin, cytokeratin, S100, von Willebrand factor (factor VIII), Mac 387, CD3, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, and CD79a. The majority of the sarcomas showed greater than 70\% staining for MHC class II. We conclude that these undifferentiated sarcomas in Flat-Coated Retrievers belong to a spectrum of tumors with varying proportions of characteristic cell types and morphologic features, some of which fit the diagnostic criteria for malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Many of these sarcomas seem to have a significant myofibroblast component and a mild or moderate T cell infiltrate but the precise cell lineage is still uncertain.},

We examined how these proteins interact functionally in G1E cells, a GATA-1- erythroblast line that proliferates in an SCF-dependent fashion and, upon restoration of GATA-1 function, undergoes GATA-1 proliferation arrest and Epo-dependent terminal maturation.

Here, the authors review the evidence pointing towards the mechanistic basis of meiotic defects leading to aneuploidy and discuss the potential role of environmental factors. Trisomic and monosomic (aneuploid) embryos account for at least 10\% of human pregnancies and, for women nearing the end of their reproductive lifespan, the incidence may exceed 50\%. The errors that lead to aneuploidy almost always occur in the oocyte but, despite intensive investigation, the underlying molecular basis has remained elusive. Recent studies of humans and model organisms have shed new light on the complexity of meiotic defects, providing evidence that the age-related increase in errors in the human female is not attributable to a single factor but to an interplay between unique features of oogenesis and a host of endogenous and exogenous factors.},

  abstract = {Objective To describe and characterize histiocytic sarcoma (HS) first detected in the eyes of dogs using the large database at the comparative ocular pathology laboratory of Wisconsin (COPLOW). Methods Cases diagnosed as HS were selected from the COPLOW database. Slides were reviewed to describe the cellular morphology, localize the tumor within the globe, record the tumor distribution and measure the size of the tumor. Further sections were taken to perform immunohistochemistry for Melan-A, CD18 and S-100, and for ferric iron staining. The following clinical information was recorded: breed, age, gender, laterality, clinical signs upon presentation and follow-up information obtained by response to a mailed survey and phone contact. Results Twenty-six cases were confirmed as being HS according to the immunohistochemical results (CD18 positive and Melan-A negative). The most prevalent breed was Rottweiler (eight cases), followed by Retriever breeds (seven Golden Retrievers and five Labrador Retrievers). The mean age was 8.61 {$\pm$} 2.43 years. There were three intact male, eight castrated male, one intact female and 14 spayed female dogs. In 15 dogs there were no concurrent systemic clinical signs at the time of diagnosis. Sixteen of 19 dogs with follow-up information available died as a result of causes related to the tumor, although only three of them received a necropsy. Survival time varied between 5 days and 6 months after enucleation. Three of the dogs were alive at the time the information was gathered. Mean tumor surface was 0.613 {$\pm$} 0.38 cm2. S-100 was diffusely positive in 10 cases, isolated positive cells were found in 11 cases and five cases were completely negative. Seven of the cases were positive for ferric iron. Conclusions Histiocytic sarcoma must be considered in the differential diagnosis of dogs with intraocular masses, especially in Rottweilers and Retriever breeds. Because it carries poor prognosis, it must be distinguished from melanoma. A good discriminator for this purpose in paraffin-embedded tissues is finding CD18-positive cells and no reactivity against Melan-A. S-100 and ferric iron staining does not seem to be useful. Ocular HS is considered to be a manifestation of a systemic disease even when the disease is first recognized in the eye.},

  abstract = {Estradiol production is most commonly thought of as an endocrine product of the ovary; however, there are many tissues that have the capacity to synthesize estrogens from androgen and to use estrogen in a paracrine or intracrine fashion. In addition, other organs such as the adipose tissue can contribute significantly to the circulating pool of estrogens. There is increasing evidence that in both men and women extraglandular production of C18 steroids from C19 precursors is important in normal physiology as well as in pathophysiologic states. The enzyme aromatase is found in a number of human tissues and cells, including ovarian granulosa cells, the placental syncytiotrophoblast, adipose and skin fibroblasts, bone, and the brain, and it locally catalyzes the conversion of C19 steroids to estrogens. Aromatase expression in adipose tissue and possibly the skin primarily accounts for the extraglandular (peripheral) formation of estrogen and increases as a function of body weight and advancing age. Sufficient circulating levels of the biologically active estrogen estradiol can be produced as a result of extraglandular aromatization of androstenedione to estrone that is subsequently reduced to estradiol in peripheral tissues to cause uterine bleeding and endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in obese anovulatory or postmenopausal women. Extraglandular aromatase expression in adipose tissue and skin (via increasing circulating levels of estradiol) and bone (via increasing local estrogen concentrations) is of paramount importance in slowing the rate of postmenopausal bone loss. Moreover, excessive or inappropriate aromatase expression was demonstrated in adipose fibroblasts surrounding a breast carcinoma, endometriosis-derived stromal cells, and stromal cells in endometrial cancer, giving rise to increased local estrogen concentrations in these tissues. Whether systemically delivered or locally produced, elevated estrogen levels will promote the growth of these steroid-responsive tissues. Finally, local estrogen biosynthesis by aromatase activity in the brain may be important in the regulation of various cognitive and hypothalamic functions. The regulation of aromatase expression in human cells via alternatively used promoters, which can be activated or inhibited by various hormones, increases the complexity of estrogen biosynthesis in the human body. Aromatase expression is under the control of the classically located proximal promoter II in the ovary and a far distal promoter I.1 (40 kilobases upstream of the translation initiation site) in the placenta. In skin, the promoter is I.4. In adipose tissue, 2 other promoters (I.4 and I.3) located between I.1 and II are used in addition to the ovarian-type promoter II. In addition, promoter use in adipose fibroblasts switches between promoters II/I.3 and I.4 upon treatments of these cells with PGE2 versus glucocorticoids plus cytokines. Moreover, the presence of a carcinoma in breast adipose tissue also causes a switch of promoter use from I.4 to II/I.3. Thus there can be complex mechanisms that regulate the extraglandular production of estrogen in a tissue-specific and state-specific fashion. (J Am Acad Dermatol 2001;45:S116-24.)},

  abstract = {Purpose Dogs have been proposed as spontaneous animal models of human breast cancer, based on clinicopathologic similarities between canine and human mammary carcinomas. We hypothesized that a better knowledge of the natural history and prognostic factors of canine invasive mammary carcinomas would favor the design of preclinical trials using dogs as models of breast cancer. Methods The 2-year outcome of 350 female dogs with spontaneous invasive mammary carcinoma was studied. The investigated prognostic factors included age at diagnosis, pathologic tumor size, pathologic nodal stage, lympho-vascular invasion, histological grade, and expression of Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER{$\alpha$}), Progesterone Receptor, Ki-67, Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2, basal cytokeratins 5/6, and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. Multivariate survival analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Results The overall survival after mastectomy was 11 months. Within 1 year post mastectomy, 41.5\% of dogs (145/350) died from their mammary carcinoma. By multivariate analysis, the significant prognostic factors for overall survival included a pathologic tumor size larger than 20 mm [HR 1.47 (95\% confidence interval 1.15\textendash 1.89)], a positive nodal stage [pN+, HR 1.89 (1.43\textendash 2.48)], a histological grade III [HR 1.32 (1.02\textendash 1.69)], ER{$\alpha$} negativity [HR 1.39 (1.01\textendash 1.89)], a high Ki-67 proliferation index [HR 1.32 (1.04\textendash 1.67)], and EGFR absence [HR 1.33 (1.04\textendash 1.69)]. Conclusion The short natural history of spontaneous canine invasive mammary carcinomas and high rate of cancer-related death allow for rapid termination of preclinical investigations. The prognostic factors of invasive mammary carcinomas are remarkably similar in dogs and humans, highlighting the similarities in cancer biology between both species.},

Likewise, gDNA increased {$<$}2-fold on day 14 in BCT as opposed to a 456-fold increase in K3EDTA tubes. Similar results were observed after samples were shipped. Conclusions: Cell-Free DNA BCTs prevent gDNA contamination that may occur due to nucleated cell disruption during sample storage and shipping. This novel blood collection tube provides a method for obtaining stable cfDNA samples for rare target detection and accurate analysis while mitigating the threat of gDNA contamination. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors.},

Because mast cell numbers are increased at sites of inflammation in allergic diseases, pharmacologic intervention into the proliferation, migration, and survival (or apoptosis) of mast cells could be a promising strategy for the management of allergic diseases. Mast cells differentiate from multipotent hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow. Stem cell factor (SCF) is a major chemotactic factor for mast cells and their progenitors. SCF also elicits cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion, facilitates the proliferation, and sustains the survival, differentiation, and maturation, of mast cells. Therefore, many aspects of mast cell biology can be understood as interactions of mast cells and their precursors with SCF and factors that modulate their responses to SCF and its signaling pathways. Numerous factors known to have such a capacity include cytokines that are secreted from activated T cells and other immune cells including mast cells themselves. Recent studies also demonstrated that monomeric IgE binding to FcepsilonRI can enhance mast-cell survival.

When osteoblastic cells were cultured for 28 days to induce differentiation into mature osteoblasts capable of forming bone nodules, ER{$\beta$} mRNA was constantly and highly expressed during the entire culture period. In contrast, the level of ER{$\alpha$} mRNA was very low at the beginning of culture and it gradually increased during the differentiation of osteoblastic cells. Various tissues including bone were isolated from 8-week-old rats of both sexes, and total RNA was extracted to compare the tissue distribution of expression levels of ER{$\beta$} mRNA. In cancellous bone of the distal femoral metaphysis and lumbar vertebra, expression of ER{$\beta$} mRNA was obvious, and its level was equivalent to those in the uterus and testis, but lower than those in the ovary and prostate.

  abstract = {Dogs are second only to humans in medical surveillance and preventative health care, leading to a recent perception of increased cancer incidence. Scientific priorities in veterinary oncology have thus shifted, with a demand for cancer genetic screens, better diagnostics, and more effective therapies. Most dog breeds came into existence within the last 300 years, and many are derived from small numbers of founders. Each has undergone strong artificial selection, in which dog fanciers selected for many traits, including body size, fur type, color, skull shape, and behavior, to create novel breeds. The adoption of the breed barrier rule\textemdash no dog may become a registered member of a breed unless both its dam and its sire are registered members\textemdash ensures a relatively closed genetic pool within each breed. As a result, there is strong phenotypic homogeneity within breeds but extraordinary phenotypic variation between breeds. One consequence of this is the high level of breed-associated genetic disease. We and others have taken advantage of this to identify genes for a large number of canine maladies for which mouse models do not exist, particularly with regard to cancer.},

  abstract = {The dog has emerged as a premier species for the study of morphology, behavior, and disease. The recent availability of a high-quality draft sequence lifts the dog system to a new threshold. We provide a primer to use the dog genome by first focusing on its evolutionary history. We overview the relationship of dogs to wild canids and discuss their origin and domestication. Dogs clearly originated from a substantial number of gray wolves and dog breeds define distinct genetic units that can be divided into at least four hierarchical groupings. We review evidence showing that dogs have high levels of linkage disequilibrium. Consequently, given that dog breeds express specific phenotypic traits and vary in behavior and the incidence of genetic disease, genomic-wide scans for linkage disequilibrium may allow the discovery of genes influencing breed-specific characteristics. Finally, we review studies that have utilized the dog to understand the genetic underpinning of several traits, and we summarize genomic resources that can be used to advance such studies. We suggest that given these resources and the unique characteristics of breeds, that the dog is a uniquely valuable resource for studying the genetic basis of complex traits. \textcopyright 2005 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

In total DLBCL patients, DBC1 and AR expression were significantly associated with high clinical stage, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, and high international prognostic index scores, and they predicted shorter overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) by univariate analysis. DBC1 expression was also an independent prognostic indicator by multivariate analysis (OS, P = .017; RFS, P = .004).

  abstract = {The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has been increasing steadily for the last 30 years, and attention is being focused on the possible causes of this increase. Possible explanations have included the exposure to viruses, radiation, nutrition, and pesticides, and these issues are addressed by other presentations in this workshop. The interest in a possible role of pesticides stems from the observation that farmers have an increased risk of NHL. However, farmers may also be exposed to oncogenic viruses carried by farm animals, and studies of abattoir workers and meat inspectors have found increased risks of NHL; although these findings are unlikely to be directly relevant to the general population, they do complement other suggestions that exposure to oncogenic viruses may be a factor in the general increase in NHL. Farmers may also be exposed to chronic antigenic stimulation which may increase the risk of NHL. This latter observation is consistent with the observation that NHL is associated with several autoimmune diseases which involve chronic antigenic stimulation. NHL has also been associated with a number of occupational exposures but these are generally rare and the findings are inconsistent, although a number of studies have found an increased risk of NHL in work involving exposure to wood, solvents, or related chemicals. Perhaps the strongest evidence of an association with an environmental exposure comes from two studies showing that use of hair dyes increases the risk of NHL. This exposure is relatively common in women, and hair dye use may account for approximately 20\% of all NHL cases in women. However, it is not known if hair dye use has increased during the last 40 years. The evidence for an increased risk of NHL from other life-style factors such as alcohol, tobacco, and medication is generally weak and inconsistent.},

  abstract = {Background: Domesticated from gray wolves between 10 and 40kya in Eurasia, dogs display a vast array of phenotypes that differ from their ancestors, yet mirror other domesticated animal species, a phenomenon known as the domestication syndrome. Here, we use signatures persisting in dog genomes to identify genes and pathways possibly altered by the selective pressures of domestication. Results: Whole-genome SNP analyses of 43 globally distributed village dogs and 10 wolves differentiated signatures resulting from domestication rather than breed formation. We identified 246 candidate domestication regions containing 10.8Mb of genome sequence and 429 genes. The regions share haplotypes with ancient dogs, suggesting that the detected signals are not the result of recent selection. Gene enrichments highlight numerous genes linked to neural crest and central nervous system development as well as neurological function. Read depth analysis suggests that copy number variation played a minor role in dog domestication. Conclusions: Our results identify genes that act early in embryogenesis and can confer phenotypes distinguishing domesticated dogs from wolves, such as tameness, smaller jaws, floppy ears, and diminished craniofacial development as the targets of selection during domestication. These differences reflect the phenotypes of the domestication syndrome, which can be explained by alterations in the migration or activity of neural crest cells during development. We propose that initial selection during early dog domestication was for behavior, a trait influenced by genes which act in the neural crest, which secondarily gave rise to the phenotypes of modern dogs.},

To identify the genetic underpinnings of such traits, we analyze 722 canine whole genome sequences (WGS), documenting over 91 million single nucleotide and small indels, creating a large catalog of genomic variation for a companion animal species. We undertake both selective sweep analyses and genome wide association studies (GWAS) inclusive of over 144 modern breeds, 54 wild canids and a hundred village dogs. Our results identify variants of strong impact associated with 16 phenotypes, including body weight variation which, when combined with existing data, explain greater than 90\% of body size variation in dogs. We thus demonstrate that GWAS and selection scans performed with WGS are powerful complementary methods for expanding the utility of companion animal systems for the study of mammalian growth and biology.},

  abstract = {Ovariectomy (OVX) in animal models is an accepted method to simulate postmenopausal osteoprosis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been recently shown to play an important role during endochondral bone formation, hypertrophic cartilage remodeling, ossification, and angiogenesis. We hypothesized that reduced VEGF expression in bone contributes to OVX-induced bone loss and tested it in a miniature pig model and in vitro using human osteoblasts. Seventeen primiparous sows (G\"ottingen miniature pigs) were allocated to two experimental groups when they were 30 months old: a control group (n = 9) and an OVX group (n = 8). After 15 months, VEGF levels in lumbar vertebrae were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and verified by Western blot analysis. VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR) were localized by immunohistochemistry. Expression of VEGF mRNA was analyzed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Differently sulfated glycosaminoglycans were localized in subchondral bone histochemically. Osteoblasts were immunopositive for VEGF. VEGF concentration in the vertebra was 27\% lower in OVX miniature pigs. VEGFR-2 could be immunostained on osteoblasts. VEGF mRNA and protein were detectable in the lumbar vertebrae of all animals. In subchondral trabecular bone of OVX animals, significantly more islands of mineralized cartilage containing chondroitin 4- and 6-sulfate or keratan sulfate occurred compared to the control group. The occurrence of remnants of mineralized cartilage in subchondral bone of the OVX group may be caused by a delayed bone turnover due to low VEGF levels. In vitro experiments revealed an increase of VEGF in the supernatant of osteoblasts after incubation with estradiol. In conclusion, estrogen seems to be a key factor for regulation of VEGF expression in bone. Loss of VEGF due to menopause may be a reason for reduction of bone density.},

  abstract = {Human driven selection during domestication and subsequent breed formation and breeding has left detectable signatures within the genome of livestock breeds. The elucidation of these signatures of selection is of interest from the perspective of evolutionary biology and for identifying selected genes that ultimately may help to further genetically improve these economically important species. Genome-wide screenings based on population techniques provide analytical tools to detect these signatures in relation to the act of selection. This review outlines a nonmathematical treatment of the theories and approaches available to scan the genome for evidence of positive selection and is intended for readers who are little or not familiar with population genetics theory. We discuss the genetics underlying phenotypic variation and adaptation and highlight molecular pattern that positive selection leaves behind along with the statistical approaches that are developed to detect such signatures. We describe some of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different strategies and also the challenges with identifying signatures of selection. Ascertainment bias with widely used SNP arrays is also a topic of interest. Finally we review approaches to assess the statistical significance of a signal at a particular locus or window and discuss factors affecting the statistical power to detect selective sweeps. \textcopyright{} 2014.},

Our aim was to determine the efficacy of the administration of percutaneous intralesional 3\% polidocanol (hydroxypolyaethoxydodecan) as sclerotherapy.Between July 1997 and December 2004 we treated 72 patients (46 males, 26 females) with a histologically-proven diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst, at various skeletal sites using this method. The sclerotherapy was performed under fluoroscopic guidance and general anaesthesia or sedation and local anaesthesia. The mean follow-up period was 34 months (26.5 to 80). The patients were evaluated using the Enneking system for functional assessment and all the lesions were radiologically quantified into four grades.The mean age of patients was 15.6 years (3 to 38) and the mean number of injections was three (1 to 5). Ten patients were cured by a single injection. The mean reduction in size of the lesion (radiological healing) was found to be 76.6\% (61.9\% to 93.2\%) with a mean clinical response of 84.5\% (73.4\% to 100\%). Recurrence was seen in two patients (2.8\%) within two years of treatment and both were treated successfully by further sclerotherapy.Percutaneous sclerotherapy with polidocanol is a safe alternative to conventional surgery for the treatment of an aneurysmal bone cyst. It can be used at surgically-inaccessible sites and treatment can be performed on an out-patient basis.},

Veterinary hospital records of 759 client-owned, intact and neutered female and male dogs, 1\textendash 8 years old, were examined for diagnoses of hip dysplasia (HD), cranial cruciate ligament tear (CCL), lymphosarcoma (LSA), hemangiosarcoma (HSA), and mast cell tumor (MCT). Patients were classified as intact, or neutered early (\&lt;12 mo) or late ({$\geq$}12 mo). Statistical analyses involved survival analyses and incidence rate comparisons.

Thymic lymphomas induced by the Rickard strain of FeLV (FeLV-R) are of prothymocyte or (immature) cortical thymocyte origin, as these express terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, the guinea pig erythrocyte rosette receptor, Ia antigens, partial cortisone sensitivity, and nonspecific esterase. Lymphomas associated with other strains of FeLV form rosettes with guinea pig erythrocytes, frequently have Ia antigens and cytoplasmic nonspecific esterase, and probably originate from helper T-cells, monocyte/macrophages, or null cells. These data belie previous conclusions that FeLV leukemogenesis is restricted to mature T-cells; rather, the considerable heterogeneity in the surface and cytochemical phenotype of feline lymphomas probably reflects transformation of multipotent lymphoid or monocytoid precursors in the bone marrow by FeLV.},

  abstract = {Mitotic index (MI) is an indirect measure of cell proliferation that has been demonstrated to be a strong predictor of outcome for several human and canine cancers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of MI as a predictor of biologic behavior and survival in dogs with cutaneous mast cell tumors (MCTs). Medical records from 148 dogs with histologically confirmed MCTs were reviewed. Information regarding tumor grade, local recurrence, metastatic disease, date of death/last follow-up, and outcome was obtained. The region of the tumor with the highest overall mitotic activity was chosen for evaluation, and the MI value was defined as the number of mitotic figures/10 high-power fields (4003, 2.7 mm 2). A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to compare MI with survival data. A Mann-Whitney test was used to compare MI on the basis of the development of local recurrence and metastatic disease. The MI correlated directly with tumor grade (P , .0001). The median survival time for dogs with an MI \#5 was significantly longer (70 months) than for those with an MI .5 (2 months), regardless of grade (P , .001). For grade II tumors with an MI \#5, the median survival time (MST) was 70 months, compared with 5 months for those with an MI .5 (P , .001). For grade III tumors with an MI \#5, the MST was not reached, compared with ,2 months for those with an MI .5 (P , .001). In conclusion, MI is a strong predictor of overall survival for dogs with cutaneous MCTs and should be included as a prognostic indicator when determining therapeutic options.},

Little is known about the natural history of this infection since patients are usually recognized as having the infection only after years or decades of chronic disease. Several animal models of H. pylori infection, including those with different species of rodents, nonhuman primates, and germ-free animals, have been developed. Here we describe a new animal model in which the clinical, pathological, microbiological, and immunological aspects of human acute and chronic infection are mimicked and which allows us to monitor these aspects of infection within the same individuals. Conventional Beagle dogs were infected orally with a mouse-adapted strain of H. pylori and monitored for up to 24 weeks. Acute infection caused vomiting and diarrhea. The acute phase was followed by polymorphonuclear cell infiltration, interleukin 8 induction, mononuclear cell recruitment, and the appearance of a specific antibody response against H. pylori. The chronic phase was characterized by gastritis, epithelial alterations, superficial erosions, and the appearance of the typical macroscopic follicles that in humans are considered possible precursors of MALT lymphoma. In conclusion, infection in this model mimics closely human infection and allows us to study those phases that cannot be studied in humans. This new model can be a unique tool for learning more about the disease and for developing strategies for treatment and prevention.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori has been widely recognized as an important human pathogen responsible for chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric cancer, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Little is known about the natural history of this infection since patients are usually recognized as having the infection only after years or decades of chronic disease. Several animal models of H. pylori infection, including those with different species of rodents, nonhuman primates, and germ-free animals, have been developed. Here we describe a new animal model in which the clinical, pathological, microbiological, and immunological aspects of human acute and chronic infection are mimicked and which allows us to monitor these aspects of infection within the same individuals. Conventional Beagle dogs were infected orally with a mouse-adapted strain of H. pylori and monitored for up to 24 weeks. Acute infection caused vomiting and diarrhea. The acute phase was followed by polymorphonuclear cell infiltration, interleukin 8 induction, mononuclear cell recruitment, and the appearance of a specific antibody response against H. pylori. The chronic phase was characterized by gastritis, epithelial alterations, superficial erosions, and the appearance of the typical macroscopic follicles that in humans are considered possible precursors of MALT lymphoma. In conclusion, infection in this model mimics closely human infection and allows us to study those phases that cannot be studied in humans. This new model can be a unique tool for learning more about the disease and for developing strategies for treatment and prevention.},

Included were ulcers with spurting (Forrest Ia) or oozing bleeding (F lb) or a visible vessel (F IIa). In case of F Ia/Ib the endoscopic therapy in both groups was combined with a preliminary injection of epinephrine (1:104). After endoscopic hemostasis the patients were transferred to the surgical intensive care unit. The patients underwent routine endoscopy 24 h later. If rebleeding signs occurred, emergency endoscopy was performed. In the case of rebleeding or a still visible vessel another injection therapy now with fibrin sealant in both groups was performed. Initial hemostasis was achieved in 100\% of cases in group A and in 77\% in group B (p {$\leq$} 0.05). Recurrent hemorrhage occurred in 10\% in group A and in 38\% in group B (p {$\leq$} 0.05). Permanent hemostasis was achieved in 93\% in group A and 88\% in group B. There were no differences between the two groups in the requirement for emergency surgery or mortality. A tendency toward a lower blood transfusion requirement was observed in group A, but it failed to achieve statistical significance. No complications of injection therapy were noted.},

  abstract = {Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract are frequently observed in children and represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. These conditions are phenotypically variable, often affecting several segments of the urinary tract simultaneously, making clinical classification and diagnosis difficult. Renal agenesis/hypoplasia and dysplasia account for a significant portion of these anomalies, and a genetic contribution to its cause is being increasingly recognized. Nevertheless, overlap between diseases and challenges in clinical diagnosis complicate studies attempting to discover new genes underlying this anomaly. Most of the insights in kidney development derive from studies in mouse models or from rare, syndromic forms of human developmental disorders of the kidney and urinary tract. The genes implicated have been shown to regulate the reciprocal induction between the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme. Strategies to find genes causing renal agenesis/hypoplasia and dysplasia vary depending on the characteristics of the study population available. The approaches range from candidate gene association or resequencing studies to traditional linkage studies, using outbred pedigrees or genetic isolates, to search for structural variation in the genome. Each of these strategies has advantages and pitfalls and some have led to significant discoveries in human disease. However, renal agenesis/ hypoplasia and dysplasia still represents a challenge, both for the clinicians who attempt a precise diagnosis and for the geneticist who tries to unravel the genetic basis, and a better classification requires molecular definition to be retrospectively improved. The goal appears to be feasible with the large multicentric collaborative groups that share the same objectives and resources. \textcopyright{} IPNA 2007.},

We genotyped 43 brown (including brown and white) and 34 black (including tricolor, black-and-tan, and black and white) dogs. All 43 of the brown group carried two or more of these sequence variants likely to interfere with TYRP1 function, whereas 0 of 34 in the black group carried two or more of these variants (10 carried one variant). We also genotyped 13 black-nosed and 10 brown-nosed dogs whose coat color was described as red, yellow, gold, apricot, or orange (including various degrees of white). All these dogs were homozygous for a R306X MC1R variant shown to be associated with these coat color phenotypes. The black or brown nose correlated perfectly with the absence or presence of the same three TYRP1 variants described above. TYRP1 was linkage mapped to dog chromosome 11, with a SNP in exon 7.},

  abstract = {In 1997, investigators isolated a secreted glycoprotein that blocked osteoclast differentiation from precursor cells, prevented osteoporosis (decreased bone mass) when administered to ovariectomized rats, and resulted in osteopetrosis (increased bone mass) when overexpressed in transgenic mice. Since then, the isolation and characterization of the protein named osteoprotegerin (OPG) has stimulated much work in the fields of endocrinology, rheumatology, and immunology. OPG functions as a soluble decoy receptor for receptor activator of nuclear factor-{$\kappa$}B ligand (RANKL, or OPG ligand) and shares homologies with other members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. OPG acts by competing with the receptor activator of nuclear factor-{$\kappa$}B, which is expressed on osteoclasts and dendritic cells for specifically binding to RANKL. RANKL is crucially involved in osteoclast functions and bone remodeling as well as immune cell cross-talks, dendritic cell survival, and lymph node organogenesis. More recently, emerging evidence from in vitro studies and mouse genetics attributed OPG an important role in vascular biology. In fact, OPG could represent the long sought-after molecular link between arterial calcification and bone resorption, which underlies the clinical coincidence of vascular disease and osteoporosis, which are most prevalent in postmenopausal women and elderly people.},

Because dogs show remarkable intrabreed homogeneity, coupled with striking interbreed heterogeneity, the dog offers unique opportunities to understand the genetic underpinnings of natural variation in mammals, a portion of which is disease susceptibility. In this review, we highlight the unique features of the dog, such as population diversity and breed structure, that make it particularly amenable to genetic studies. We highlight recent advances in understanding the architecture of the dog genome, which propel the system to the forefront of consideration when selecting a system for disease gene studies. The most notable benefit of using the dog for genetic studies is that dogs get many of the same diseases as humans, with a similar frequency, and the same genetic factors are often involved. We discuss two approaches for localizing disease genes in the dog and provide examples of ongoing studies.},

Cancers that have been difficult to study in human families or populations are of particular interest. Histiocytic sarcoma is a rare and poorly understood neoplasm in humans that occurs in 15\% to 25\% of Bernese Mountain Dogs (BMD). Methods: Genomic DNA was collected from affected and unaffected BMD in North America and Europe. Both independent and combined genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used to identify cancer-associated loci. Fine mapping and sequencing narrowed the primary locus to a single gene region. Results: Both populations shared the same primary locus, which features a single haplotype spanning MTAP and part of CDKN2A and is present in 96\% of affected BMD. The haplotype is within the region homologous to human chromosome 9p21, which has been implicated in several types of cancer. Conclusions: We present the first GWAS for histiocytic sarcoma in any species. The data identify an associated haplotype in the highly cited tumor suppressor locus near CDKN2A. These data show the power of studying distinctive malignancies in highly predisposed dog breeds. Impact: Here, we establish a naturally occurring model of cancer susceptibility due to CDKN2 dysregula-tion, thus providing insight about this cancer-associated, complex, and poorly understood genomic region.},

These sera were retrospectively assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Fifty-one (14.4\%) of the FeLV-positive sera had antibodies to FIV, indicating dual oncovirus and lentivirus infections. FIV infections were confirmed by Western blot analysis, antibodies against the 15 and 27 kDa proteins being used as definitive markers. FIV infection was diagnosed in one cat sampled in 1968 and in eight other cats sampled before 1975 in New York City. Illnesses exhibited by coinfected cats were similar to those of cats infected with FeLV only. Two unrelated cats with multicentric fibrosarcomas were found to be simultaneously infected with FIV, FeLV, and feline sarcoma virus. FIV was less contagious than FeLV in 73 cats residing in an exposure household between 1977 and 1980 as determined by evaluation of sera collected sequentially. In this household, 15 resident cats became FeLV infected whereas no cats contracted FIV infection. Comparison of serologic results from 53 cats with leukemia/lymphoma and matched controls confirmed a strong correlation between FeLV viremia and leukemia/lymphoma. A significant correlation between FIV infection and lymphoproliferative malignancies was also found independent of FeLV infection.         (C) Lippincott-Raven Publishers.},

A two-hour infusion of EDTA followed by a two-hour recovery period elicited a rapid response in PTH production, highly correlated to the changes in ionized calcium, but no significant difference in response was observed between Sham and Ovh groups. A short-term (24-h) infusion of 1\textendash 34 hPTH increased circulating ionized calcium and 1,25-(OH)2-D levels to a similar extent in both groups. The levels of alkaline phosphatase were constant and both groups showed a small but nonsignificant increase in osteocalcin. The lack of sizable responses in histomorphometric, bone mass and biochemical parameters may limit the utility of dogs for the study of cancellous bone loss in ovarian-dysfunction osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {Abstract: In sclerotherapy for esophageal varices, the mechanism of intravariceal thrombus formation produced by a sclerosant (polidocanol, ethanolamine oleate, etc) is thought to be endothelial cell damage. Polidocanol (polyoxethylene monododecyl ether) has an average ethylene oxide chain length of 9 (\~n= 9) and is a non-ionic surfactant. The extent of vascular endothelial cell damage is thought to be dependent on (1) the concentration (\%) of polidocanol, (2) the length of ethylene oxide chains(n), and (3) the duration of exposure of endothelial cells to the sclerosant. Using these parameters, we evaluated the efficacy of sclerotherapy in two experimental systems employing cultured human endothelial cells and canine mesenteric veins. As the sclerosant concentration was increased, the extent of cell damage became greater, suggesting that thrombus formation can be more effectively induced with a higher concentration of sclerosant. As for the length of the ethylene oxide chains, a sclerosant with \~n=12 showed markedly reduced cytotoxicity as compared to those with \~n= 6 and \~n= 8. Cytotoxicity increased in proportion to the duration of exposure to the sclerosant, suggesting that exposure time is a key determinant of vascular endothelial cell damage. From these results, it is concluded that sclerotherapy for esophageal varices will be more effective if a high concentration of sclerosant is used for large varices with high blood flow, provided that a suitable ethylene oxide chain length is used and that the sclerosant is retained in the varices for 30\textendash 60 seconds.},

  abstract = {In premenopausal women, the ovaries are the principle source of estradiol, which functions as a circulating hormone to act on distal target tissues. However, in postmenopausal women when the ovaries cease to produce estrogen, and in men, this is no longer the case, because estradiol is no longer solely an endocrine factor. Instead, it is produced in a number of extragonadal sites and acts locally at these sites as a paracrine or even intracrine factor. These sites include the mesenchymal cells of adipose tissue including that of the breast, osteoblasts and chondrocytes of bone, the vascular endothelium and aortic smooth muscle cells, and numerous sites in the brain. Thus, circulating levels of estrogens in postmenopausal women and in men are not the drivers of estrogen action, they are reactive rather than proactive. This is because in these cases circulating estrogen originates in the extragonadal sites where it acts locally, and if it escapes local metabolism then it enters the circulation. Therefore, circulating levels reflect rather than direct estrogen action in postmenopausal women and in men. Tissue-specific regulation of CYP19 expression is achieved through the use of distinct promoters, each of which is regulated by different hormonal factors and second messenger signaling pathways. Thus, in the ovary, CYP19 expression is regulated by FSH which acts through cyclic AMP via the proximal promoter II, whereas in placenta the distal promoter I.1 regulates CYP19 expression in response to retinoids. In adipose tissue and bone by contrast, another distal promoter\textemdash promoter I.4\textemdash drives CYP19 expression under the control of glucocorticoids, class 1 cytokines and TNF{$\alpha$}. The importance of this unique aspect of the tissue-specific regulation of aromatase expression lies in the fact that the low circulating levels of estrogens which are observed in postmenopausal women have little bearing on the concentrations of estrogen in, for example, a breast tumor, which can reach levels at least one order of magnitude greater than those present in the circulation, due to local synthesis within the breast. Thus, the estrogen which is responsible for breast cancer development, for the maintenance of bone mineralization and for the maintenance of cognitive function is not circulating estrogen but rather that which is produced locally at these specific sites within the breast, bone and brain. In breast adipose of breast cancer patients, aromatase activity and CYP19 expression are elevated. This occurs in response to tumor-derived factors such as prostaglandin E2 produced by breast tumor fibroblasts and epithelium as well as infiltrating macrophages. This increased CYP19 expression is associated with a switch in promoter usage from the normal adipose-specific promoter I.4 to the cyclic AMP responsive promoter, promoter II. Since these two promoters are regulated by different cohorts of transcription factors and coactivators, it follows that the differential regulation of CYP19 expression via alternative promoters in disease-free and cancerous breast adipose tissue may permit the development of selective aromatase modulators (SAMs) that target the aberrant overexpression of aromatase in cancerous breast, whilst sparing estrogen synthesis in other sites such as normal adipose tissue, bone and brain.},

Taken together with the epidemiological evidence that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and, less consistently, parity, are inversely associated with colon cancer, it has been hypothesized that estrogens are associated with MSI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate sex-specific differences in the prevalence of MSI in colon tumors and to determine whether reproductive history and hormonal exposures are associated with MSI. Using data from a population-based case-control study of 1836 cases with MSI data and 2410 population-based controls, we evaluated sex, reproductive factors, and hormone exposure in relation to the presence or absence of MSI in tumors. MSI was evaluated by a panel of 10 tetranucleotide repeats, the noncoding mononucleotide repeat BAT-26, and the coding mononucleotide repeat in transforming growth factor {$\beta$} receptor type II (TGF{$\beta$}RII). Exposure data on reproduction, hormone use, obesity, and physical activity were obtained from an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Women were less likely then men to have MSI+ tumors at a young age and more likely to have unstable tumors at an older age; we observed a significant interaction (P {$<$} 0.01) between age, sex, and MSI. Evaluation of reproductive factors showed that women who had ever been pregnant had half the risk of MSI+ tumors compared with women who had never been pregnant. In complementary fashion, total ovulatory months were associated with an increased risk of MSI+ tumors [odds ratio (OR), 2.1; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.1\textendash 4.0 comparing MSI+ versus MSI- tumors]. Age at first and last pregnancy did not influence the association. The observed associations were strongest among women {$<$}60 years of age at the time of diagnosis.

The excess of MSI+ tumors in women is explained by the excess of MSI+ tumors at older ages. Our data suggest that estrogen exposure in women protects against MSI, whereas the lack of estrogen in older women increases risk of instability. HRT in these older women may, again, reduce the risk of unstable tumors.

MAP and renal vascular resistance (RVR) responses to Ang II were recorded with and without a Rho kinase inhibitor, fasudil, in anesthetized NZGH. Western blot was used to analyze target protein expression in the kidney.Results: MAP responses to AT1 receptor inhibition and exogenous Ang II were attenuated in castrated NZGH. The increase in RVR (mm Hg/ml/min/g kidney) at the maximum dose of Ang II was significantly lower in castrated NZGH than in sham operated NZGH. Testosterone replacement restored RVR responses to Ang II in castrated rats. Fasudil treatment reduced both MAP and RVR responses to Ang II in each group. In addition, the differential MAP and RVR responses to Ang II amongst the three groups were significantly attenuated by Rho kinase inhibition. Western blot showed that Rho kinase protein expression was reduced by castration, while testosterone replacement restored the Rho kinase protein levels in castrated rats. The phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1), a downstream target of Rho kinase, was also increased by androgens.Conclusions: Collectively, these results indicate that androgens potentiate Ang II-induced renal vascular responses, an effect mediated at least partly via up-regulation of the Rho kinase signaling pathway.},

In a spectrum of myeloid disorders ranging from clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) to secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (sAML), MDS is distinguished by the presence of peripheral blood cytopenias, dysplastic haematopoietic differentiation and the absence of features that define acute leukaemia. More than 50 recurrently mutated genes are involved in the pathogenesis of MDS, including genes that encode proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing, epigenetic regulation and transcription. In this Review we discuss the molecular processes that lead to CHIP and further clonal evolution to MDS and sAML. We also highlight the ways in which these insights are shaping the clinical management of MDS, including classification schemata, prognostic scoring systems and therapeutic approaches.},

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is of current interest for its application in whole genome association mapping, since the extent of LD determines the feasibility of such studies. We have measured LD at five genomic intervals, each 5 Mb in length and composed of five clusters of sequence variants spaced 800 kb-1.6 Mb apart. These intervals are located on canine chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 34, and 37, and none is under obvious selective pressure. Approximately 20 unrelated dogs were assayed from each of five breeds: Akita, Bernese Mountain Dog, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, and Pekingese. At each genomic interval, SNPs and indels were discovered and typed by resequencing. Strikingly, LD in canines is much more extensive than in humans: D{${'}$} falls to 0.5 at 400-700 kb in Golden Retriever and Labrador Retriever, 2.4 Mb in Akita, and 3-3.2 Mb in Bernese Mountain Dog and Pekingese. LD in dog breeds is up to 100x more extensive than in humans, suggesting that a correspondingly smaller number of markers will be required for association mapping studies in dogs compared to humans. We also report low haplotype diversity within regions of high LD, with 80\% of chromosomes in a breed carrying two to four haplotypes, as well as a high degree of haplotype sharing among breeds. \textcopyright{} 2004 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

  abstract = {During the last 15 years spectacular progress has been achieved in knowledge on the dog genome organization and the molecular background of hereditary diseases in this species. A majority of canine genetic diseases have their counterparts in humans and thus dogs are considered as a very important large animal model in human biomedicine. Among canine monogenic diseases with known causative gene mutations there are two large groups classified as retinal dystrophies and lysosomal storage diseases. Specific types of these diseases are usually diagnosed in a single or several breeds. A well known disorder, restricted to a single breed, is congenital stationary night blindness described in Briards. This disease is a counterpart of Leber amaurosis in children. On the other hand, one of the most common monogenic human diseases (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), has its canine counterparts in several breeds (e.g., the Golden retriever, Beagle and German short-haired pointer). For some of the canine diseases gene therapy strategy was successfully applied, e.g., for congenital stationary night blindness, rod-cone dystrophy and muccopolysaccharydoses type I, IIIB and VII. Since phenotypic variability between the breeds is exceptionally high, the dog is an interesting model to study the molecular background of congenital malformations (e.g., dwarfism and osteoporosis imperfecta). Also disorders of sexual development (DSD), especially testicular or ovotesticular DSD (78,XX; SRY-negative), which is widely distributed across dozens of breeds, are of particular interest. Studies on the genetic background of canine cancers, a major health problem in this species, are also quite advanced. On the other hand, genetic studies on canine counterparts of major human complex diseases (e.g., obesity, the metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus) are still in their infancy. \textcopyright{} 2014 Society for Biology of Reproduction \& the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn.},

Thus, gonadectomy in either sex is associated with an increase in bone remodeling, increased bone resorption, and a relative deficit in bone formation, resulting in accelerated bone loss. Recent physiological studies have established an important role for estrogen in regulating bone turnover not only in females, but also in males. Studies in mice with knock out of the estrogen receptor, aromatase, or androgen receptor have provided important insights into the in vivo mechanisms of sex steroid action on bone. The cellular and molecular mediators of sex steroid effects on the bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts are also being increasingly better defined. Estrogen inhibits bone remodeling by concurrently suppressing osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis from marrow precursors. Both estrogen and androgens inhibit bone resorption via effects on the receptor activator of NF-{$\kappa$}B ligand (RANKL)/RANK/osteoprotegerin system, as well as by reducing the production of a number of pro-resorptive cytokines, along with direct effects on osteoclast activity and lifespan. Sex steroid effects on bone formation are also likely mediated by multiple mechanisms, including a prolongation of osteoblast lifespan via non-genotropic mechanisms, as well as effects on osteoblast differentiation and function. These pleiotropic actions of sex steroids on virtually all aspects of bone metabolism belie the importance of the skeleton not only in providing structural support for the body and in locomotion, but also as a dynamic tissue responsive, among other things, to the reproductive needs of the organism for calcium.},

Both estrogen and androgens inhibit bone resorption via effects on the receptor activator of NF-{$\kappa$}B ligand (RANKL)/RANK/osteoprotegerin system, as well as by reducing the production of a number of pro-resorptive cytokines, along with direct effects on osteoclast activity and lifespan. Sex steroid effects on bone formation are also likely mediated by multiple mechanisms, including a prolongation of osteoblast lifespan via non-genotropic mechanisms, as well as effects on osteoblast differentiation and function. These pleiotropic actions of sex steroids on virtually all aspects of bone metabolism belie the importance of the skeleton not only in providing structural support for the body and in locomotion, but also as a dynamic tissue responsive, among other things, to the reproductive needs of the organism for calcium.},

However, the clinical significance of the new entities and the practical utility of this new proposal have not been studied. Therefore, we performed a clinical evaluation of the ILSG classification. A cohort of 1,403 cases of NHL was organized at nine study sites around the world and consisted of consecutive patients seen between 1988 and 1990 who were previously untreated. A detailed protocol for histologic and clinical analysis was followed at each site, and immunologic characterization as to T- or B-cell phenotype was required. Five expert hematopathologists visited the sites and each classified each case using the ILSG classification. A consensus diagnosis was also reached in each case, and each expert rereviewed a 20\% random sample of the cases. Clinical correlations and survival analyses were then performed. A diagnosis of NHL was confirmed in 1,378 (98.2\%) of the cases. The most common lymphoma types were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (31\%) and follicular lymphoma (22\%), whereas the new entities comprised 21\% of the cases. Diagnostic accuracy was at least 85\% for most of the major lymphoma types, and reproducibility of the diagnosis was 85\%. Immunophenotyping improved the diagnostic accuracy by 10\% to 45\% for a number of the major types. The clinical features of the new entities were distinctive. Both the histologic types and the patient characteristics as defined by the International Prognostic Index predicted for patient survival. In conclusion we found that the ILSG classification can be readily applied and identifies clinically distinctive types of NHL. However, for clinical application, prognostic factors as defined by the International Prognostic Index must be combined with the histologic diagnosis for appropriate clinical decisions.},

However, the clinical significance of the new entities and the practical utility of this new proposal have not been studied. Therefore, we performed a clinical evaluation of the ILSG classification. A cohort of 1,403 cases of NHL was organized at nine study sites around the world and consisted of consecutive patients seen between 1988 and 1990 who were previously untreated. A detailed protocol for histologic and clinical analysis was followed at each site, and immunologic characterization as to T- or B-cell phenotype was required. Five expert hematopathologists visited the sites and each classified each case using the ILSG classification. A consensus diagnosis was also reached in each case, and each expert rereviewed a 20\% random sample of the cases. Clinical correlations and survival analyses were then performed. A diagnosis of NHL was confirmed in 1,378 (98.2\%) of the cases. The most common lymphoma types were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (31\%) and follicular lymphoma (22\%), whereas the new entities comprised 21\% of the cases. Diagnostic accuracy was at least 85\% for most of the major lymphoma types, and reproducibility of the diagnosis was 85\%. Immunophenotyping improved the diagnostic accuracy by 10\% to 45\% for a number of the major types. The clinical features of the new entities were distinctive. Both the histologic types and the patient characteristics as defined by the International Prognostic Index predicted for patient survival. In conclusion we found that the ILSG classification can be readily applied and identifies clinically distinctive types of NHL. However, for clinical application, prognostic factors as defined by the International Prognostic Index must be combined with the histologic diagnosis for appropriate clinical decisions.},

  abstract = {We have previously shown that estrogen withdrawal by gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRHa) induces osteocyte death via apoptosis in human bone. Although it is likely that the increase in osteocyte death via apoptosis was related to the loss of estrogen, these experiments could not rule out a direct role for the GnRHa. Therefore, in this study, we have used a rat model of ovariectomy (OVX) to determine whether the effect of estrogen withdrawal extends to other species and to clarify the role of estrogen in the maintenance of osteocyte viability. Twelve 9-week-old rats were divided into three treatment groups: sham operated (SHAM) (n = 4), OVX (n = 4), and OVX + estrogen (E2) (25 {$\mu$}g/day) (n = 4). At 3 weeks following the start of treatment, tibial bones were removed. The percentage of osteocytes displaying DNA breaks, using an in situ nick-translation method, was significantly higher in the OVX group compared with the SHAM control in both cortical bone (10.04\% vs. 2.31\%, respectively; p {$<$} 0.0001) and trabecular bone (6.44\% vs. 1.58\%, respectively; p = 0.003). Addition of estrogen in the OVX animals completely abrogated the increase in osteocyte apoptosis in cortical bone (0.78\%) and trabecular bone (1.17\%). The percentage of apoptotic osteocytes decreased with increasing distance from the primary/secondary spongiosa interface below the growth plate in the OVX model and the OVX + E2 model. Nuclear morphology and electrophoresis of DNA confirmed the presence of apoptotic cells in the samples. In conclusion, OVX in the rat results in an increase in osteocyte apoptosis as a direct or indirect result of E2 loss. Addition of estrogen in the OVX animals prevents this increase in osteocyte apoptosis. These data confirm an important role for estrogen in the control of osteocyte apoptosis and the maintenance of osteocyte viability. Estrogen deficiency might, through compromising the viability of osteocyte networks, reduce the ability of bone to respond appropriately to loading.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Circulating plasma DNA is being increasingly used for biomedical and clinical research as a substrate for genetic testing. However, cell lysis can occur hours after venipuncture when using standard tubes for blood collection, leading to an increase in contaminating cellular DNA that may hinder analysis of circulating plasma DNA. Cell stabilization agents can prevent cellular lysis for several days, reducing the need for immediate plasma preparation after venipuncture, thereby facilitating the ease of blood collection and sample preparation for clinical research. However, the majority of cell stabilizing reagents have not been formally tested for their ability to preserve circulating plasma tumor DNA. Design \& methods: In this study, we compared the properties of two cell stabilizing reagents, the cell-free DNA BCT tube and the PAXgene tube, by collecting blood samples from metastatic breast cancer patients and measuring genome equivalents of plasma DNA by droplet digital PCR. We compared wild type PIK3CA genome equivalents and also assayed for two PIK3CA hotspot mutations, E545K and H1047R. Results: Our results demonstrate that blood stored for 7. days in BCT tubes did not show evidence of cell lysis, whereas PAXgene tubes showed an order of magnitude increase in genome equivalents, indicative of considerable cellular lysis. Conclusions: We conclude that BCT tubes can prevent lysis and cellular release of genomic DNA of blood samples from cancer patients when stored at room temperature, and could therefore be of benefit for blood specimen collections in clinical trials.},

We critically review minimum population size requirements for species based on empirical and theoretical estimates made over the past few decades. This literature collectively shows that thousands (not hundreds) of individuals are required for a population to have an acceptable probability of riding-out environmental fluctuation and catastrophic events, and ensuring the continuation of evolutionary processes. The evidence is clear, yet conservation policy does not appear to reflect these findings, with pragmatic concerns on feasibility over-riding biological risk assessment. As such, we argue that conservation biology faces a dilemma akin to those working on the physical basis of climate change, where scientific recommendations on carbon emission reductions are compromised by policy makers. There is no obvious resolution other than a more explicit acceptance of the trade-offs implied when population viability requirements are ignored. We recommend that conservation planners include demographic and genetic thresholds in their assessments, and recognise implicit triage where these are not met. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of female sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone are well established, however the role of testosterone is not completely understood. Evidence from unrelated studies points to an immunosuppressive role of testosterone on different components of the immune system, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remains unknown. In this review we evaluate the effect of testosterone on key cellular components of innate and adaptive immunity.

  abstract = {Sex-based disparities in immune responses are well known phenomena. The two most important factors accounting for the sex-bias in immunity are genetics and sex hormones. Effects of female sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone are well established, however the role of testosterone is not completely understood. Evidence from unrelated studies points to an immunosuppressive role of testosterone on different components of the immune system, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remains unknown. In this review we evaluate the effect of testosterone on key cellular components of innate and adaptive immunity. Specifically, we highlight the importance of testosterone in down-regulating the systemic immune response by cell type specific effects in the context of immunological disorders. Further studies are required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of testosterone-induced immunosuppression, leading the way to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for immune disorders.},

Our results indicate that US-born graduate students are more willing to add an undeserved coauthor if the person who requests it is a faculty member in the student's department as opposed to a fellow student. Students are most likely to add an undeserving author if a faculty member is also their advisor. In addition, four techniques of neutralisation, `diffusion of responsibility', `defence of necessity', `advantageous comparison' and `euphemistic labelling', are associated with student willingness to act unethically. Participants who had received responsible conduct of research training were no less likely to commit the violation than those who had not. Knowledge of these influencing factors for QRPs will provide for opportunities to improve research ethics education strategies and materials.},

We observed nuclear localization of SNAI1 at an early stage of fibroblast reprogramming and using mouse fibroblasts expressing a knockin SNAI1-YFP reporter found cells expressing SNAI1 reprogrammed at higher efficiency. We further demonstrated that SNAI1 binds the let-7 promoter, which may play a role in reduced expression of let-7 microRNAs, enforced expression of which, early in the reprogramming process, compromises efficiency.

  abstract = {BackgroundMinimally invasive approaches such as sclerotherapy have been introduced to treat aneurysmal bone cysts. Sclerotherapy has been associated with reasonable healing rates during the past two decades. However, it is unclear whether sclerotherapy compares with the more traditional extended curettage and bone grafting.Questions/purposesWe therefore compared the healing rates and functional scores in patients having percutaneous repetitive sclerotherapy using polidocanol (Group 1) with those with intralesional excision (extended curettage with a high-speed burr) and bone grafting (Group 2) for treatment of aneurysmal bone cyst.Patients and MethodsWe randomly divided 94 patients into two treatment groups. We assessed healing rates (primary outcome measure), pain relief, time to healing and recurrence, hospital stay, and the Enneking functional score. Forty-five patients from Group 1 and 46 from Group 2 were available for study. The minimum followup was 3.2 years (mean, 4.4 years; range, 3.2\textendash 6.1 years).ResultsAt last followup, 93.3\% in Group 1 and 84.8\% in Group 2 had achieved healing. Complications in Group 1 were minor and resolved. In Group 2, three patients had deep infections and five had superficial infections, and two had growth disturbances. Although the healing rates were similar, we found higher rates of clinically important complications, worse functional outcomes, and higher hospital burden associated with intralesional excision.ConclusionsRepetitive sclerotherapy using polidocanol is a minimally invasive, safer method of treatment for aneurysmal bone cysts compared with intralesional excision and bone grafting. In this preliminary study, we found similar recurrence rates for the two treatment methods, however, this will require confirmation in larger studies.Level of EvidenceLevel II, therapeutic study.

  abstract = {Precision oncology is predicated upon the ability to detect specific actionable genomic alterations and to monitor their adaptive evolution during treatment to counter resistance. Because of spatial and temporal heterogeneity and comorbidities associated with obtaining tumor tissues, especially in the case of metastatic disease, traditional methods for tumor sampling are impractical for this application. Known to be present in the blood of cancer patients for decades, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is beginning to inform on tumor genetics, tumor burden, and mechanisms of progression and drug resistance. This substrate is amenable for inexpensive noninvasive testing and thus presents a viable approach to serial sampling for screening and monitoring tumor progression. The fragmentation, low yield, and variable admixture of normal DNA present formidable technical challenges for realization of this potential. This review summarizes the history of cfDNA discovery, its biological properties, and explores emerging technologies for clinically relevant sequence-based analysis of cfDNA in cancer patients. Molecular barcoding (or Unique Molecular Identifier, UMI)-based methods currently appear to offer an optimal balance between sensitivity, flexibility, and cost and constitute a promising approach for clinically relevant assays for near real-time monitoring of treatment-induced mutational adaptations to guide evidence-based precision oncology.

  abstract = {Advances in genome technology have facilitated a new understanding of the historical and genetic processes crucial to rapid phenotypic evolution under domestication,. To understand the process of dog diversification better, we conducted an extensive genome-wide survey of more than 48,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms in dogs and their wild progenitor, the grey wolf. Here we show that dog breeds share a higher proportion of multi-locus haplotypes unique to grey wolves from the Middle East, indicating that they are a dominant source of genetic diversity for dogs rather than wolves from east Asia, as suggested by mitochondrial DNA sequence data. Furthermore, we find a surprising correspondence between genetic and phenotypic/functional breed groupings but there are exceptions that suggest phenotypic diversification depended in part on the repeated crossing of individuals with novel phenotypes. Our results show that Middle Eastern wolves were a critical source of genome diversity, although interbreeding with local wolf populations clearly occurred elsewhere in the early history of specific lineages. More recently, the evolution of modern dog breeds seems to have been an iterative process that drew on a limited genetic toolkit to create remarkable phenotypic diversity.},

  abstract = {Estrogens have long been known as important regulators of the female reproductive functions; however, our understanding of the role estrogens play in the human body has changed significantly over the past years. It is now commonly accepted that estrogens and androgens have important functions in both female and male physiology and pathology. This is in part due to the local synthesis and action of estrogens that broadens the role of estrogen signaling beyond that of the endocrine system. Furthermore, there are several different mechanisms through which the three estrogen receptors (ERs), ER{$\alpha$}, ER{$\beta$} and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) are able to regulate target gene transcription. ER{$\alpha$} and ER{$\beta$} are mostly associated with the direct and indirect genomic signaling pathways that result in target gene expression. Membrane-bound GPER1 is on the other hand responsible for the rapid non-genomic actions of estrogens that activate various protein-kinase cascades. Estrogen signaling is also tightly connected with another important regulatory entity, i.e. epigenetic mechanisms. Posttranslational histone modifications, microRNAs (miRNAs) and DNA methylation have been shown to influence gene expression of ERs as well as being regulated by estrogen signaling. Moreover, several coregulators of estrogen signaling also exhibit chromatin-modifying activities further underlining the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in estrogen signaling. This review wishes to highlight the newer aspects of estrogen signaling that exceed its classical endocrine regulatory role, especially emphasizing its tight intertwinement with epigenetic mechanisms.},

To study c-Kit signaling pathways in the hematopoietic system we have compared c-Kit downstream signaling events in SF-dependent hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)\textendash like cell lines to those of mast cells. Both Erk and protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt are activated by ligand-induced activation of the c-Kit receptor in the HSC-like cell lines.

SF-induced activation of Ras is not affected by inhibition of PI-3 kinase. In mast cells and other more committed hematopoietic precursors, the activation of Erk by SF is not PI-3 kinase dependent. Our results suggest that a molecular signaling switch occurs during differentiation in the hematopoietic system whereby immature hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells use a PI-3 kinase\textendash sensitive pathway in the activation of both Erk and PKB/Akt, which is then switched upon differentiation to the more commonly described PI-3 kinase\textendash independent mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway.},

A human VEGF ELISA was used for analysis. Results: Mean plasma VEGF was 7.2{$\pm$}7.8 pg/ml. Mean plasma VEGF level varied among different tumour types with the highest level in oral melanomas (12.4 pg/ml). In patients with sarcomas of soft tissue or bone origin, plasma VEGF levels increased significantly with decreasing haemoglobin concentration (p=0.013).

  abstract = {Hip dysplasia (malformation of the coxofemoral joint) in dogs is a major health problem for which the British Veterinary Association (BVA) had set up a control scheme in 1965. Based on scoring nine components of the radiographs of both the left and right joints, the degree of hip joint malformation is now quantified by an overall hip score (a measure of the condition of the hip joint). The hip scores of 1258 flat-coated retrievers and 1566 Newfoundlands (registered with The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom) were analysed after merging with Kennel Club pedigree data for 19 036 flat-coated retrievers registered by 1995 and 14 336 Newfoundlands registered by 1997. The merged data included the animal's identity, date of birth, sex and hip scores and also similar records for the dog's relatives including the hip score if the relative had been tested. In recent years, breeding has been increasingly from tested parents. There has been some reduction in offspring hip scores - presumably because breeders avoided breeding from males with very high scores. However, a much greater reduction in offspring hip score would be achieved by stricter science-based selection of potential sires and dams. Regression modelling quantified the positive relationship between offspring and parental hip scores. The genetic heritability of hip scores was large and significant in both breeds (particularly from dams). The breeders in UK tended to use healthy sires for breeding but they have taken less care in selecting dams. Our regression models emphasise the need for both sires and dams, particularly dams, to be healthy with very small hip scores. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

In Granta-519 MCL tumors, activation of ER{$\beta$} reduced expression of BAFF and GRB7, 2 important molecules involved in B-cell proliferation and survival.

Mast cells contain several mediators or cytokines influencing vascularization. To clarify the role of mast cells in angiosarcoma, mast cells were counted in primary lesions of angiosarcoma (n=7).

  abstract = {Objective\textemdash To evaluate canine histiocytic sarcoma cell lines and tumor samples for dysregulation of the Kit/stem-cell factor (SCF), Flt3/Flt3 ligand (Flt3L), and Met/hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, as these are known to contribute to the differentiation and survival of normal dendritic cells as well as malignant transformation of dendritic cells in mouse models. Sample Population\textemdash 4 histiocytic sarcoma tumor cell lines and 35 formalin-fixed histiocytic sarcoma specimens obtained from dogs. Procedure\textemdash Histiocytic sarcoma cell lines were evaluated for expression of Kit/SCF, Flt3/Flt3L, and Met/HGF by use of reverse transcriptase-PCR procedures. Histiocytic sarcoma cell lines and tumor samples were evaluated for mutations in Kit, Flt3, and Met by use of PCR analysis of genomic DNA, followed by both sequencing and fluorescent PAGE for deletions or internal tandem duplications. The ability of the multitargeted split-kinase inhibitor SU11654 to block proliferation and induce apoptosis of histiocytic sarcoma cell lines was also evaluated. Results\textemdash No mutations in Kit, Flt3, and Met were identified in any of the cell lines or tumor samples evaluated. Furthermore, SU11654 did not induce cellcycle arrest or apoptosis of histiocytic sarcoma lines, even at supratherapeutic doses. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance\textemdash These data suggest that dysregulation of Kit/SCF, Flt3/Flt3L, and Met/HGF signaling pathways is unlikely to occur in histiocytic sarcomas of dogs and that inhibitors of the Kit, Flt3, and Met pathways are unlikely to provide clinical benefit to dogs with histiocytic sarcomas.},

  abstract = {Estrogens exert their physiological effects on target tissues by interacting with the estrogen receptors, ER{$\alpha$} and ER{$\beta$}. Estrogen replacement is one the most common and effective strategies used to prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Whereas it was thought that estrogens work exclusively by inhibiting bone resorption, our previous results show that 17{$\beta$}-estradiol (E2) increases mouse bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 mRNA, suggesting that estrogens may also enhance bone formation. In this study, we used quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis to demonstrate that estrogens increase BMP-2 mRNA in mouse mesenchymal stem cells. The selective ER modulators, tamoxifen, raloxifene, and ICI-182,780 (ICI), failed to enhance BMP-2 mRNA, whereas ICI inhibited E2 stimulation of expression. To investigate if estrogens increase BMP-2 expression by transcriptional mechanisms and if the response is mediated by ER{$\alpha$} and/or ER{$\beta$}, we studied the effects of estrogens on BMP-2 promoter activity in transient transfected C3H10T1/2 cells. E2 produced a dose-dependent induction of the mouse -2712 BMP-2 promoter activity in cells cotransfected with ER{$\alpha$} and ER{$\beta$}. At a dose of 10 nm E2, ER{$\alpha$} induced mouse BMP-2 promoter activity 9-fold, whereas a 3-fold increase was observed in cells cotransfected with ER{$\beta$}. Tamoxifen and raloxifene were weak activators of the mouse BMP-2 promoter via ER{$\alpha$}, but not via ER{$\beta$}. ICI blocked the activation of BMP-2 promoter activity by E2 acting via both ER{$\alpha$} and ER{$\beta$}, indicating that mouse BMP-2 promoter activation is ER dependent. In contrast to E2 and selective ER modulators, the phytoestrogen, genistein was more effective at activating the mouse BMP-2 promoter with ER{$\beta$}, compared with ER{$\alpha$}. Using a deletion series of the BMP-2 promoter, we determined that AP-1 or Sp1 sites are not required for E2 activation. A mutation in a sequence at -415 to -402 (5{${'}$}-GGGCCActcTGACCC-3{${'}$}) that resembles the classical estrogen-responsive element abolished the activation of the BMP-2 promoter in response to E2. Our studies demonstrate that E2 activation of mouse BMP-2 gene transcription requires ER{$\alpha$} or ER{$\beta$} acting via a variant estrogen-responsive element binding site in the promoter, with ER{$\alpha$} being the more efficacious regulator. Estrogenic compounds may enhance bone formation by increasing the transcription of the BMP-2 gene.},

  abstract = {The potential of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a diagnostic, predictive and prognostic biomarker, has clearly been recognized and numerous studies have already proven clinical utility of ctDNA analyses. As ctDNA reflects the full spectrum of tumor-specific alterations, a wide range of methodological approaches have been developed for the analysis of ctDNA. While targeted approaches have the potential of capturing major known driver mutations at a high resolution, these methods mostly interrogate only single or small set of genes and are therefore unable to assess the genetic heterogeneity of ctDNA in an unbiased manner. However, given that tumor genomes are constantly changing as a consequence of progression or under the selective pressures of targeted therapies, a comprehensive genome-wide analysis is advantageous at least in late-stage cancer patients. Despite the advantages of ensuring a comprehensive view on the genetic landscape, untargeted and genome-wide methods such was whole exome sequencing (WES) or whole genome sequencing (WGS) are currently limited to samples with the elevated levels of total ctDNA since deep sequencing at an exome- or genome-wide level is still prohibitively expensive. Here, we review studies which applied untargeted approaches for ctDNA analyses including WES, WGS and epigenetic profiling, highlight the advantages over targeted approaches and discuss related limitations. Moreover, we present novel approaches of ctDNA, which move beyond somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) and single nucleotide variants (SNV).},
